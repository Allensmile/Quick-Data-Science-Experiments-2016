once again mr costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few i just did not care about any of the characters most of us have ghosts in the closet and costner s character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time i did not care the character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident ashton kutcher the problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he s better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet his only obstacle appears to be winning over costner finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker costner tells us all about kutcher s ghosts we are told why kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing no magic here it was all i could do to keep from turning it off an hour in 
this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same generic and boring there s really nothing worth watching here a complete waste of the then barely tapped talents of ice t and ice cube who ve each proven many times over that they are capable of acting and acting well don t bother with this one go see new jack city ricochet or watch new york undercover for ice t or boyz n the hood higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal ice t s horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth and i m still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film and why the heck does he always play the exact same character from aliens onward every film i ve seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character and at least in aliens his character died which made it somewhat gratifying overall this is second rate action trash there are countless better films to see and if you really want to see this one watch judgement night which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera the cinematography was almost refreshing which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself but not quite 
first of all i hate those moronic rappers who could nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clich e version of gangsters the movie doesn t take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we re already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie except for the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brain bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters i did nt like him right from the start the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no one everybody dies except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they re actors by profession not annoying ugly brain dead rappers stay away from this crap and watch hours and instead at lest they have characters you care about a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast 
not even the beatles could write songs everyone liked and although walter hill is no mop top he s second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film the emergence of the rapper turned movie star was in full swing the acting took a back seat to each man s overpowering regional accent and transparent acting this was one of the many ice t movies i saw as a kid and loved only to watch them later and cringe bill paxton and william sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications i hand it to walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location but i fault everyone involved for turning out lame o performances ice t and cube must have been red hot at this time and while i ve enjoyed both their careers as rappers in my opinion they fell flat in this movie it s about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief now this is a movie its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie but there were many and they led nowhere i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was sord of confused and just playing things off the cuff there are two things i still enjoy about it one involves a scene with a needle and the other is sadler s huge pistol bottom line this movie is like domino s pizza yeah ill eat it if i m hungry and i don t feel like cooking but i m well aware it tastes like crap stars meh 
brass pictures movies is not a fitting word for them really are somewhat brassy their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours in this they fail miserably their undeniable but rather soft and flabby than steamy erotic qualities non withstanding senso is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence brass moved the action from the th into the th century to be exact so there are mussolini murals men in black shirts german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans but it is just window dressing the historic context is completely negligible anna galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick she is an attractive versatile well trained italian actress and clearly above the material her wide range of facial expressions signalling boredom loathing delight fear hate and ecstasy are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves it 
a funny thing happened to me while watching mosquito on the one hand the hero is a deaf mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does mutilating mannequins er excuse me corpses through his images on the other hand the english version at least is very badly dubbed so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time this film is stupid funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town and lurid where would we be in a s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene not to mention the romantic aspect oh how sweet miss it 
this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism but this is supposed based upon a true character our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father he also has a doll fetish but i cannot figure out where that came from his co workers find out and tease him terribly during the day a mild manner accountant and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls they are all attractive of course else we wouldn t care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist he graduates eventually to actually killing and that is what gets him caught like i said a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood 
being a long time fan of japanese film i expected more than this i can t really be bothered to write to much as this movie is just so poor the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever pity i couldn t stand the awful acting the mess they called pacing and the standard quirky japanese story if you ve noticed how many japanese movies use characters plots and twists that seem too different forcedly so then steer clear of this movie seriously a year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along and that s not a good thing in my book fans of beat takeshi his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo and unless you re a rabid fan you don t need to suffer through this waste of film 
 tokyo eyes tells of a year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop this lame flick is about filler and talk talk and more talk you ll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus talk and play video games talk and get a haircut talk and walk and walk and talk talk on cell phones hang out and talk etc as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value a meager cast and no action no romance no sex or nudity no heavy drama just incessant yadayadayada ing c 
wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long standing no trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes blonde hair and some perky moves on the dance floor th century fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges it is very heavy on the frenetic gymnastic like dancing exceedingly thin on story betty grable an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye gives it a boost even though she s paired with leaden don ameche in tan make up and slick hair also good charlotte greenwood as betty s pithy aunt a limousine driver who s constantly asleep on the job and carmen miranda playing herself who else the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot and some of the supporting performances are quite awful by the time of the big horserace finale most viewers will have had enough from 
cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise elizabeth shue actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood i literally vomited while watching this film of course i had the flu but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode why can t nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor heck nobody could do it better the search begins for nick s contract with lucifer or was it lou cipher from night train to terror 
first of all i would like to say that i am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that i rented it i wanted to like it i think that the main reason that i was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller in my eyes a suspense thriller for british movies is like something out of a ruth rendell novel something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon this movie started out with the promising note of being such a film we have our main character that suspects a man that he does not like of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants his notions prove to be right but the idea that his wife might be involved does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime the elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this point but from there i felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is the film might have been enjoyable to me if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover s triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller this seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film i felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did i felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized so i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations 
so tell me what serious boozer drinks budweiser how many suicidally obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboy s bachelor pad bar would be proud to boast and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriend s tits with it just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shue s assets cage seems to be portraying the most attention seeking look at me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street walker she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings skin lacerations anal rape and graphic verbal abuse all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clich d sentimental sexual fantasy of the tart with a heart still i did watch it to the end by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shue s tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly pathetically smiling while cage all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake grimaced and mugged his way through the final half hour 
a big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film incredibly bad very pretentious it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute we don t really learn anything about this character except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic we don t know why nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual but i feel that this role and this script let him down and how after not being able to perform for the whole film can he have an erection on his deathbed really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath 
this film is absolutely appalling and awful it s not low budget it s a no budget film that makes ed wood s movies look like art the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit there is sadism as you would expect from an s italian video nasty no talent was used to make this film and the female love interest has a huge bhind italian taste maybe even for s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren t so many films available on video or viewers weren t really discerning this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it s not even funny just boring and extremely cheap it s actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this 
here s a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game turkey shoot gymkata and the running man certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work generally bland action sequences a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout take for example towards the end of the film when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep upon discovery of the said corpse the villains response bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit however i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode even if his screen time is very limited not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b movie enthusiasts 
at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called the final executioner at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an ex cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and that s about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the weirdest array of costumes i ve seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier it s a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i m still puzzling over that one myself now 
earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust well parts of the earth because somewhere in italy a band of purebred survivors those without radioactive contamination are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims alan william mang who looks not surprisingly a lot like kurt russell and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters who are led by edra marina costa and erasmus harrison muller jr alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam woody strode who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat strode is by far the best thing about the film though he doesn t look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time as for the story it s a blending of elements from better films and stories including ten little indians the most dangerous game and escape from new york the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans 
many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today soon u will know someone in the house has died the dead person s wife is worried about preparing food for so many people her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji one of the dead person s son is speaking with someone over the mobile daughter is busy with her makeup her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind revealing the face its anupam kher suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed is it his dream or a flash back u won t get an answer until the end of the movie well this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream is this a film comedy well it is supposed to belong to that category but it actually does not there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police so everyone must cheat the cheats or forget about justice music by bapi tutul dhruv dhalla is ok nothing much to tell about other sectors bad script destroys everything not even anupam kher s performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool

the best thing about the prey is the tag line it s not human and it s got an axe the movie itself is a padded stinkaroo endless insect and wildlife shots make the viewer wanna die no slasher fan will like this garbage watch friday the th again and burn any copy of this film you find it also rates as one of the worst films ever made 
this is truly without exaggerating one of the worst slasher movies ever made i know it came out in the s following a tendency started by friday the th the prey copies the fore mentioned movie in many aspects the woods setting the killer the dumb teens the gore etc but the prey is as bad as you might expect i didn t even remember about it if it wasn t for coincidence well the killer is in fact human so don t expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason the situations rather boring and lack of tension gore violence etc it just does not works for a slasher flick the acting is simply horrid the score is horrible a combination of boring instruments with cheesy s tunes i won t even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me it seems that it cost only dollars please avoid this one like the plague it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen and that s something to say thank god it seems to have vanished from earth 
i m a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn t sufficiently heed good advice too bad i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watson s character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking wilkinson s control freak moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lord s dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started over the top sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me she s just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wife s affection increasing with every kick she gives him i m not anti pc or anything it just didn t ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the director s intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last minutes convincing me that these two people just don t belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing i m not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much my score 
sure most of the slasher films of the s were not worth the celluloid they were filmed on but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping of course and you know this already they begin getting killed one by one by a mysterious stranger the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard bait john carl buechler my least favorite b movie guy did the lousy makeup effects here the cast features carel struycken of the witches of eastwick and the addams family movies sadly he does not pop up until the very end of the film and is covered in burn makeup rendering him unrecognizable steve bond anyone remember him is here in an early role as a victim brown s direction and the script he cowrote both smell like the presents brown bears leave in the woods he pads the film with so much stock wilderness footage i thought i accidentally rented a special episode of mutual of omaha s wild kingdom much of the cast sits around the campfire and eats then walk and sit and eat again the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put in a slasher film he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a baby deer jackie coogan who must have forgot he once worked with the legends of silent cinema has two scenes and is involved in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film he and the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread yeah there is not one minute of suspense here the killer a forest fire survivor looking for a mate watches the students from behind trees we know it is the killer because the film makers have dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake the viewer up every few minutes skip this pile of pine sap and rent halloween instead this is rated r for physical violence mild gun violence gore some profanity brief female nudity mild sexual content sexual references and drug abuse 
i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those films to be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the clich teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat clich and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back story of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the back story ends abruptly and shows us some stock footage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isn t shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like cropsy from the burning but better as for gore there isn t too much although there s an ok face squishing moment at the end overall i wouldn t recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess 
 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like don t go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as don t go into the woods but it s still not great either one thing is that it s just boring and acting isn t very good but much better than dgitw and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldn t contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney looking all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didn t find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better 
everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to the prey endless nature footage bad acting aside from these elements this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases is considered a cult classic jackson bostwick and jackie coogan play pretty well off each other there s also a three minute banjo solo that shows off bostwick s skill behind the instrument not too bad if i do say so myself the last ten minutes of the film are its saving grace the ending still haunts me to this day this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl bucheler does the special effects some may know him from films like troll and friday the th part he directed both these films all in all this isn t a movie everyone will find something redeeming in in fact on a hollywood level this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts but for that handful yet very loyal of slasher movie fans in the world even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven 
uhhh so did they even have writers for this maybe i m picky but i like a little dialog with my movies and as far as slasher films go just a sliver of character development will suffice unfortunately the prey provides neither and if you think i m being hyperbolic you ll just have to see it for yourself scene after scene we just get actors standing around looking forlorn and awkward abandoned by any sense of a script outside of calling out each other s names when they get separated in the woods natch the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation orion clearly plagiarized from funk wagnalls scintillating slasher fare no and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesn t even have anything to do with the plot wait what is the plot at other times the prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we can t exactly hear what they re saying so we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring deliberately seriously i ve seen more dialog in a silent film it s as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in rancho cucamonga in the heyday of the s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said hey i gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag let s somehow pad an entire feature around it and well they did to be fair the prey probably had some sort of writer on board i mean somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies however i am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever there are glaring pauses boring tableaux and zero sense of pacing throughout the filmmakers don t have anything else in the script to film so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced these critters are all filmed in straightforward noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography if it feels like a science film that s because it is i m pretty sure this is all nature show stock footage all that s missing is a stuffy narration from some national geographic alderman more exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute and a half a minute and a half that s a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with let alone insert into the final cut of the film way to go guys brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest admittedly the film picks up quite a bit of steam comparatively in the last minutes into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip off of b la bart k s music for strings percussion and celesta cuts in vaudeville great jackie coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby bumbly park ranger this was his last role if you can believe it and there are some nice gory moments including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation the make up used for the killer carel struycken aka lurch from the addams family movies is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young jason voorhees and freddy krueger plus if you love wacky straight outta left field endings you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up you ll do a spit take i promise usually i love films that are on this level of ineptitude but the first three quarters of the prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest overall this is a largely pallid and tedious affair and while it ain t all bad it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists why do we do this to ourselves anyway 
oh yeah this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of worst s slasher ever made the prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick a routine derivative plot that you ve seen a thousand times before and better insufferable characters and terrible performances a complete lack of gore and suspense fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and most irritating of all the largest amount of pointless padding footage you ve ever encountered in your life and that s not an exaggeration but a guarantee apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage which i ll expand upon later this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that aren t even remotely funny the set up is as rudimentary as it gets with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voice over human screams fast forward nearly forty years later when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe whacked by something that breathes heavily off screen this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer the prey is an irredeemable boring film apparently it was shot in already but nobody wanted to distribute it up until and it isn t too hard to see why in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant this would only be a short movie with a running time of minutes possibly even less there s an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage sometimes of animals that i think don t even live in that type of area and they seem to go on forever the only thing missing in fact is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals habits animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy s slasher movie for crying out loud the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile with some potent killing sequences and fine make up effects on the monster who turns out to be lurch from the addams family movies but still silliness overrules the scene with the vultures is too stupid and the final shot is just laugh out loud retarded as mentioned above the prey easily makes my own personal list of worst s slashers alongside appointment with fear berserker deadly games don t go in the woods hollow gate the stay awake and curfew 
supercraptastic slasher fare which feels overly long at minutes years ago a bunch of gypsies who lived in the caves of a mountain were burned up in a forest fire years later campers are going missing from the area of the fire a bunch of horny kids are of course en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger jackson bostwick the kids troop up to the mountain any way before long the kids start to get picked off by the monster who remains unseen to the very end of the movie probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad no surprises to speak of they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates leaving the final girl to fend for herself although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster the story itself couldn t hold the weight of feature length so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release on the plus side the wildlife footage is rather nice also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer a decent rock climbing death sequence ok gore and the great jackie coogan in his final film role as the bumbling local sheriff this is a far cry from charlie chaplin but it was still nice to see him this is for slasher completists only 
even by the lowered standards of s slasher movies this one stinks the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a forbidden part of forest which burned in the s and apparently left a sole angry survivor fast forward actually you ll want to fast forward through much of this mess to the present day where a couple of campers are butchered the teens follow in their wake while a semi concerned park ranger a sleepwalking jackie coogan and his healthier cohort who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run of the mill nature footage padding finally more killings but nothing you haven t seen a zillion times before if you want to see the kids butchered opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the th over this
foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous disfigured gypsy the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination the victim characters are all too familiar idiot teens which means one doesn t really care about them we just wonder when they will die not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless unnecessary nature footage however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere and a decent music score by don peake still it s business as usual for dead camper movies there are much better films in this vein but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die hard slasher fans although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn wrong turn or even the final terror again out of 
rented bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room leprechaun jack frost and the prey i picked up jack and lep because they are well known bad movies i have never seen i picked this movie out because it matched the how to find a bad movie guide on badmovies org no real description no pics of the movie on the back and i had never heard of it had to be a winner spoilers but this movie is so awful it doesn t matter p this is a true bad movie lep and jack frost are dumb on purpose this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew this movie starts out much like evil dead even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress unlike evil dead it never gains any speed at all for a slasher movie it is pretty bland in minutes people get killed but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting obviously to go along with the whole prey theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring the gore is horrible all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story the last minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion yet another way to add length to this the climax is such a total joke its hard to laugh at it is so bad the back of the box says the ending will shock and haunt you yes it will it will shock you that someone could put such a bad plot twist on film and haunt you because you won t believe you paid to watch this crap also the tagline is its not human and it s got an axe one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen a true out of i love laughing at bad movies but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick p
i was pulled into this movie early on much to my surprise because i hadn t intended to watch it at all now i wish i hadn t the suspense starts out well with the hit and run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out or doable now though a no no in the old days of movie making get away with it the plot s been done before what plot hasn t but the tensions inherent in it with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair make for an absorbing first half then the film abandons the hit and run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited all suffering loves the two tracks of plot hit and run and unreasoning love just don t have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters doesn t bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other at the end of the film in the midst of the movie s second funeral i found myself thinking now what does any of this have to do with that hit and run the filmmakers may think the answer obvious but i think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily 
the prey has an interesting history unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer but little else is remembered the plot is your basic killer in the woods again but ironically this was filmed before friday the th the prey was actually shot sometime in according to one of the actors in an interview years later but released for about a week at some drive ins yes jim namans drive in showed this in june of but it has a dated look to it maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by now on the story it has some kind of back story a forest fire back in the s leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death but one of their children survive our monster so flash forward to present day which would be we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster the tag line for this picture claims its not human and its got an axe but an axe was only used in these first two killings now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid s camping we all know they are the prey and the monster knocks them of one by one for an minute movie it seems longer we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the mins overall for being out into an s horror movie it looks way more s than ever hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end and we have to wait till the last minutes to see him side note the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the s 
all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple exchanging nods over their good grub a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace quadruple takes or more when people look at things solitary banjo tuning and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a fawn about a big mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many big mouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there s talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stock footage close up shots of animals birds insects and spiders in the woods the movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasn t too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands if it s true that the movie in the version available on the out of print videotape is cut perhaps if there s a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise it s simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors slasher fan 
i walked into a book store in brentwood tennessee i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real i was very excited and couldn t wait to watch it i had great expectations for it i couldn t believe what i seen when i viewed it it didn t look like a real movie it looked like a home video i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know this is no horror movie you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along i swear i did it never did get any better there were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him i didn t find that entertaining at all i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me i guess that is how bad this economy has got i have this to say to the cast and crew do not show this film as material to get other film jobs don t do it i mean that sincerely i commend you for trying for people who have bought this i say this don t sell your copy to someone they could get very upset have a nice day everyone 
thank god i didn t buy this movie myself i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed this has got to be one of the worse movies i ve ever seen i do realize they couldn t have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets the acting was horrible so was the editing the dialogue everything it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it i m looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don t have to stoop to watch this joke 
i saw this movie with my girlfriend it was a total disaster you can really see it was cheaply made badly scripted and with very bad acting i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book we couldn t take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green acres then there were parts that were vulgar they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it the witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs i thought it was nasty and very strange i really can t understand why someone would think that would be entertaining it shows another scene where dr mize arrives and betsy bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother how sick the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects i think they should have left all of that out the makeup on the reverend james johnston as a older man didn t really make you assume he was older it made you think he was dipped in fish batter the blood on joshua gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse the john bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner i rate this film capital f minus 
if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it this film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to i wouldn t recommend this one to my worst enemy it is a low budget movie with amateur actors it looks like it was filmed for a film contest the acting is terrible and it wouldn t surprise me if the script was written by a hee haw script writer my family laughed at it a grade zzzzzzzzzzzzz all the way you won t be scared by this one here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film when the guy gets his toe stomped by ric white s stupid portrayal of the reverend james johnston walking cane the guys reactions are like if he had an amputation with no pain killer watch the dvd extras after you watch the movie when you see ric white and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck don t get fooled like we did and buy this failure 
are you kidding me this is quite possibly the worst amateur movie i ve ever seen the casting was horrible the acting was worse than horrible and i m sorry the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing drew around was nothing more than comical when i herd about the bell witch i wanted to believe i read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story but this movie just destroyed that ric white director writer lead actor etc takes himself a bit too seriously and i think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves do yourself a favor skip this one 
in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club the people who think that there is anything real about this legend need to grow up this is the st century guess what ghosts don t exist most people learn that from their mother when they re about years old you guys seriously need to grow up the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesn t do it either go to college or at least finish high school 
i wanted to like this movie i really really did i was so excited when i saw the preview which scared the hell out of me but when i saw the actual film i was disappointed the acting is stilted and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced and i m sorry but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary it s just stupid i grew up on the bell witch legend so i know quite a bit about it a lot of facts in the movie are right on target but this film should have been much better the entire birthday party scene for example lasts about fifteen minutes adds nothing to the plot or the story and should have been left on the cutting room floor a more heavy handed editor might have been able to get a decent film out of this mess please understand i m not in any way shape or form involved with the other bell witch movie and i m not trying to attack this imdb listing i m just telling it like it is 
i am not understanding why people are praising this movie i didn t like it at all i watch it with several people none of them cared for it either first of all it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story the actual filming looks like a live tv interview the makeup is bad when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it there is no talent there are facts that do appear in the book the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one it has always fascinated me the bad acting really ruined the story the little boys situation really hammed it up even more when you watch this movie the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about it didn t make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her it is a whopping tale with him and his little problem i can t still get over the little girl saying mom said tobacco will rot your teeth frank fox s statement and facial expression is so bad the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho also the girl hovering over the bed and her little bladder control problem are from the exorcist this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer i also noticed that their was defects in the film quality parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs this is probably how this movie was put together someone said i like this story i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer doesn t matter if we don t know how to act as long as we get it on film and say it is good we got the family together and prepared food then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie 
this tale of the upper classes getting their come uppance and wallowing in their high class misery is like a contemporary mid sommerish version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink here people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity a well heeled london solicitor tom wilkinson discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper s husband in a hit and run accident he throws up but otherwise his stiff upper lip hardly quavers written and directed by julian fellowes who won an oscar for writing gosford park this is his directorial debut from a novel by nigel balchin it s quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended it s like a throw back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life however it s not all bad wilkinson is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson the adulterous wife and rupert everett the highly amoral high class totty are both very good at covering the cracks in the material tony pierce roberts cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it s always good on the eye 
the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in which includes an manuscript by richard williams bell son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell titled our family trouble to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line if you must know the story read about it its much more gripping and conclusive 
bell witch haunting aka the haunt is an american horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period to this is not to be confused with bell witch the movie a movie starring betsy palmer based on the same events however i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw i enjoyed betsy palmer s chilling performance in friday the th as such i believe that even on a bad day she d pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as the haunt with regard to my heading this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing it is painful to watch because it is just downright boring reading the positive reviews for this movie i could only identify three possibilities the first possibility these authors were involved in the production in some way the second possibility the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed the final possibility none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise the setting for the plot is robertson county tennessee james johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the bell witch the story is told as a series of flashbacks a series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of john bell and his family it soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all on the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair albeit one based on real events where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong and then some first the acting the acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board this factor does the most damage to the production undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer the voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines unfortunately this voice began to become very annoying very quickly i may not have been alive in the s but i find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ghost does second the direction the direction is haphazard and very uneven some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director nothing is done with the camera with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary the atmosphere is equally flat a vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them i ll give one example in one scene the spirit attacks someone see the scene for yourself it s almost funny almost third the script whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story this movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story whilst this style was also the case with british movies from the british horror heyday of the s and s it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works peter cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers the same cannot be said of the actors in the haunt finally the humour the ill guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating an obese boy is the butt of many jokes one particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet this scene should never have been included but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity the costumes were also well chosen overall the haunt is an appalling movie it is not even in the so bad it s good league it is instead just boring i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague don t even bother seeing it for free i have never seen the other movie about the bell witch but it really couldn t be any worse than the haunt could it i ll give this other movie a chance if i can track it down in the meantime i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the grudge japanese original and one missed call japanese original are good places to start 
i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til it s end even if i m not really enjoying it i rarely feel like i wasted my time but this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible it wasn t scary in the least bit what is with the comic relief moments the dialog was tedious acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open like the birthday party the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done i am curious about other adaptation but until then i will stick to reading about the story 
while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects but not really enough to add to the validity of the film i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things if a guy said a filthy comment grabbed her or made some disgusting gesture to her i would say go for it bring him down he s a pig what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are guys will look at beautiful women especially when they dress provocatively just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all some women may hate me for this but i hope not i have much respect for women i was raised by one i also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal my grandmother was the center of my family for years but i don t really feel this did anything to help women s rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself some women were offended by her project 
if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie grumpy ogre annoying donkey cute kitty obligatory dance number etc put them in a blender and condensed it to minutes you d have this mess painful to watch i may have laughed once the story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines the final reworked rendition of the christmas story poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes and boy a little eddie murphy goes a long way with its desperate attempt to be hip and current this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like the grinch will remain timeless a sad waste of effort by all involved a veritable jumping of the shark for the shrek franchise 
i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful it was pointless and just plain stupid the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life he disappears on his wedding day in a tux no less and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos we saw it with a bus load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie it was trying to be profound but it wasn t it was stupid and offensive if i wasn t on a bus i would have walked out on the movie anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned 
this is one of those strange self important self indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound it isn t instead it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity typical is the scene where peter kelsey grammer explains to protagonist and best friend adam dwier brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus concluding ultimately that life sucks so deep we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc during adam s travels through the mojave desert on foot he abruptly leaves l a the day of his wedding and his family friends and fiance assume he s dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket some characters are more entertaining than others the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others the actor james kevin ward does some great impressions including nicholson popeye and several characters from the original star trek but once the interesting characters leave the screen we re stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound it s a long trip which drags in many places in fact it s the longest hour and a half movie i ve ever seen and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at all i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv that ll learn me next time i ll try harder to sleep in 
this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the worst movies i ve ever seen i m seriously considering buying a copy if i can find one dirt cheap to chase away unwanted company it s honestly that bad i view it as some kind of anti personnel weapon if you re the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage then this movie is a gem just to be fair kelsey grammar s character has line that almost works but doesn t quite other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top and the movie doesn t even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way if you are familiar with the term word vomit then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity oh and the narrative structure is ill conceived pretentious and amateurish it has failed on both style and substance if you really hate someone invite them over for a double feature of this movie and the terror of tiny town an all midget western from the s and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open a clockwork orange style but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions 
the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is graveyard of horrors but i think that must be an error it should have been called graveyard of horribles horrible acting horrible editing horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard horrible 
what if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot well i think it would probably end up a little bit like this one i don t think i ve ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed at the beginning to complete crap by the end i only stuck with it because i kept thinking it couldn t possibly get worse well up until the very end necrophagus graveyard of horror proved me wrong who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard man evil grave robbing cultists and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad one would think there d at least be some humor value but not here 
seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i don t quite get it why has this been such a huge hit in its amateurishness drips from every scene the jokes are lame and predictable the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top that is not to say that miss rudnik does not have nice boobs the singing is schrecklich the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid eighties it s really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in and apparently still today reading my fellow imdbers comments 
from time to time it s very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world and that s what happens in the love light the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter better for her certainly because her career as a film director doesn t impress this german count the film tells the story of dame angela carlotti dame mary pickford a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a picturesque squalor an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by picturesque luxury she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela s two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead but destiny is even crueller and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with a german and to make things worse she doesn t know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal don t mean ich liebe dich but sink any damn italian boat at sea fortunately for dame angela pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him a not strange fact indeed because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians from that german love a half teutonic baby will born the wicked destiny at full speed but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity but meanwhile dame angela s secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela s sorrowful life will improve a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind but as they say in germany it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people as this german count said before it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter because as can be seen in the love light she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories ja wohl but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances and now if you ll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress 
i had to see this on the british airways plane it was terribly bad acting and a dumb story not even a kid would enjoy this something to switch off if possible 
this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local itv station at am a couple of nights ago this might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but the real howard spitz is a rather strange film strange in the way it doesn t want to upset its audience come on there s nothing kids like more than sadism and that s why roald dahl was such a popular author for children it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world in this screenplay you re just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesn t happen i m not advocating child abuse but to see howard spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better can you imagine how much worse kindergarten cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc i mean if you re making a movie centered around a children s author who hates children shouldn t the story show and not tell much of the problem lies with director vadim jean and you do get the feeling he doesn t know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show he s famous for but it fails to work here and there s many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities
caution spoiler at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured the impression is that the attack was all for nothing in reality taking the bridge at remagen was the last important victory for the western allies it was the crossing of the rhine that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months because the remagen bridge was taken the war ended in just a few weeks the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured this was enough time for the americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges the taking of the bridge was a complete success and meant the that the end of the war was near and would not last through the summer contrary to the cynical nature of the film the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it they knew how vital the battle was this film has little to do with real history it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced 
the bridge at remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i ve ever seen aside from the acting which is wooden no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows up the middle of roads and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready the constant suicidal behavior set off my tilt switch so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan unless you are under years old i recommend watching something else gb
veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column b of the harold robbins big book of plots set against a smoggy phoenix skyline post charlies angles jaclyn smith takes a star turn as the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times while jfk impersonator james franciscus lounges around the fringes mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end oh yeah and bob mitchum is in there too somewhere 
filmed in arizona by a mostly foreign crew nightkill is one of the clumsiest crime dramas i have ever seen robert mitchum in a cowboy hat trails recently widowed jaclyn smith around hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband s death jaclyn s wardrobe is of the dale evans variety and her dog is named cowboy seems as if somebody sure bought into the american myth that all westerners talk and dress like descendants of john wayne screenplay by joan andre and john case may have worked better if approached as parody this mystery thriller just plays tame with director ted post asleep at the controls don t be drawn in by the video box art of jaclyn screaming while taking a shower she does indeed take a shower in this film but it is not revealing nor does it further the murky plot one iota no stars from 
nightkill stars robert mitchum as a world weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist mike connors he is hired by jaclyn smith the anxious wife of the missing man what jaclyn fails to inform mitchum is that she knows full well her husband s whereabouts after all she was the one who helped her lover james franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby what more would expect from a rotten slasher film with robert mitchum mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end this is bad cinema and this movie is sooooo poor it makes it look like halloween mixed up with trick or treats avoid this rated r for graphic violence nudity and sexual situations 
donald sutherland an american paleontologist visiting england picks up a hitch hiker one evening two years later having discovered the man s address book in his car he returns the book to the man s opulent home only to find that the man s been hanged for murder nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder of his own stepmother because he was in sutherland s car at the time of the crime sutherland is the man s alibi but he s turned up too late out of a sense of guilt he tracks down the real murderer agatha christie s mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people all of them with one or another motive for the crime all of them suspect and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line there is often not always a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over because of the anfractuosity of the situation due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer redundancy is perfectly okay we have to keep the characters and the time lines straight christie s movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful jacqueline de bellefort oh yes that s mia farrow but this version of ordeal by innocence is a golan globus production with all that implies in the way of production values a thoughtfully prepared script and skill behind the camera the first few minutes in which sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged are fine after that everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing the script has a slapdash quality as if thrown together by two hacks overnight few of the faces are familiar and that doesn t help at all everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble the musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs some nudity is thrown in to wake up the dozers in the audience if dame agatha were alive she d be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake dullsville 
i have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life as stated in other commentaries a who s who of talent such as christopher plummer faye dunaway donald sutherland and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an agatha christie story i keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast done the right way the film has even less intimacy than the christopher reeves superman movies the large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films because there is not enough time to get to know anyone dave brubeck s progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store the music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed it s hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes was more offensive from someone who has seen most christie films that s what attracted me to this it was one of the few i hadn t seen miss this one it is not an agatha christie movie golan globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling rather than the snug atmosphere of english mystery 
three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men the three businessmen take revenge which escalates to a murder after another supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people the plot has too many holes the details were ignored in order to move the story forward the acting was uneven the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd the small budget and tight schedule were apparent the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight and the ending was just unbelievable 
this film is on my list of worst movies ever made the story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters actions all films need to have an inner logic and this film just doesn t have it the story doesn t make any sense to see faye dunaway christopher plummer and diana quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime faye dunaway is the lucky one because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film on the other hand donald sutherland must be an amazing actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad directing and bad writing his performance is believable and he manages to stay in character in spite of everything if dame agatha christie were alive she would die laughing the movie is that bad 
this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christie s work a lifeless muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace and the budget of its predecessors death on the nile evil under the sun and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go of course he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christie s plot alone all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest but the direction is hopelessly flat 
when at the very start of the film paleontologist donald sutherland arrives at the argyle family s house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around but as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably ordeal by innocence is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn t raise at any moment nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity wether you guessed or not donald sutherland cristopher plummer faye dunaway and sarah miles far from her good performance in ryan s daughter just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either you won t miss much if you skip this one 
producers golan and globus should have been ashamed to release this piece of trash publicly i know this is gonna sound cliched but compared to this the first hercules of looks like a mature and exciting epic this sequel is moronic cheap unredeemable childish phony inept and badly acted a landmark in bad cinema and one of the few few movies i ve seen that really deserve the lowest possible rating no stars 
aya if you are looking for special effects that are years before its time this is it the glowing lightning bolts fireballs etc look like they came from a cheesy s sci fi flick and yes hercules really grows he s not being pushed on a cart closer to the camera 
the adventures of hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie i ve yet run across you would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie acting bad editing bad direction bad special effects bad and laughable plot bad lighting bad cinematography bad costume design bad and silly everything else bad watching the adventures of hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal even for a fan of bad movies it s a real endurance test this is one for either masochists or lou ferrigno completists if any exist eight things i learned from watching the adventures of hercules if you don t have the budget for real special effects rotoscope a scene from the previous movie it will look great trust me when on a quest to recover zeus thunderbolts take time for frequent stops to oil up you body it worked for ferrigno and his two amazon companions any sword fight use of magic and just about all other day to day activities in ancient greece created a sound very similar to a game of pac man or asteroids some of the ancient greek gods dressed like extras from star wars if you need to pad your crappy movie s runtime extend the title sequence by adding star trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music it also helps if you ve got a previous movie to pull scenes from fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack hercules one at a time william berger did anything for money i didn t think it was possible but the adventures of hercules makes the first film hercules look like an academy award winner 
looking for a real super bad movie if you wanna have great fun don t hesitate and check this one ferrigno is incredibly bad but is also the best of this mediocrity 
from the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible hercules comes its even more preposterous read goofier sequel right off the bat we get another unwieldy beginning of time prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a superman like scrolling credits sequence narrative wise here we have four rebellious gods who steal zeus seven all important but poorly animated thunderbolts a crime which for one thing sets the moon careening on a collision course with planet earth faster than you can say nepotism zeus once again played as a white haired bearded man by the relatively young claudio cassinelli sends his champion who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to one presumes the almighty tasks performed in the first film to find his blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store no sooner has hercules lou ferrigno as if you didn t know touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels milly carlucci and sonia viviani in need of his getting them out of distress the former who would go on to become an italian tv personality seemingly has the ability to talk with the little people which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from godzilla vs mothra just so they can swindle as much unutilzed footage from the first film as is humanly possible the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol king minos william berger again from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy typically hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a gorgon an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film makers behind the much superior clash of the titans bothered to watch this flick complete with the same reflection in a shield come uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is and just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve cozzi has hercules and minos turn into a cosmic version of king kong vs godzilla for one of their battles and later still king kong gets to grips with a large snake an encounter lifted straight out of the classic original i swear it this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth as had been the case with the first film the cast is full of old reliables like the afore mentioned berger cassinelli and venantino venantini as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day and up and coming starlets not just carlucci but also maria rosaria omaggio as a younger hera serena grandi pamela prati and once again eva robbins whose costume here easily outcamps her appearance in the first film for what it s worth pino donaggio s score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film if you have stuck with this review so far you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws i m sure i ve left out some of its ineptitudes but i wouldn t forgive myself if i failed to mention the single greatest laugh out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair yes it even surpassed the afore mentioned animated titanic duel for me namely the d cor of the rebellious gods lair which is in the shape of a giant marble kettle at this stage one might well wonder why i gave this film and its predecessor a rating instead of a not entirely unjustified bomb in the past i ve had various protracted online discussions on whether one s star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment value but these are two instances where i deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating i don t know maybe it s because i m in a sword and sandal state of mind at the moment with some more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days but after all uncharacteristically for me i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit and that alone must count for something no 
although coming after three star wars krull countless others this movie would look outdated in the s sfx mostly consist of s videogames effects such as bolts etc annoying after a short while you also get a sfx creature that looks like a poor man s version of some tier iv harryhausen monster sets are mainly ruins in the countryside with papier mache temples and miniature cities or abodes that makes s japanese monster movies look like flawless perfection plot is paper extra thin hercules must find zeus seven golden thunderbolts stolen by conspiring gods zombie tyrants action mainly consists in retarded muscled up hercules check the variety of facial expressions wrestling cheap s videogames effects acting award goes to milly carlucci third carlucci show biz sister with anna gabriella which says all sfx make other tier ii italian salad bowl movies such as l umanoide star crash look like masterpieces well considering that ferrigno s main acting exploit consisted in impersonating a retarded green monster wearing a whig and green espadrillas we ought to be lenient watch it forget about it 
 jurassic park iii ___ adventure sam nell the dish william macy happy texas fargo tz a leoni family man a better title would be escape from the island of really mean dinosaurs but then no one would need to see the film in this sequel a rag tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang gliding accident access hollywood reports jp began filming without a completed script that explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state of the art special effects sure there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits but no meaningful plot line to tie them together the dinosaur puppets and animation in jp are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever but the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original jurassic park or even jp jp is a mercifully short minutes the last minutes of which is credits even at that i found myself frequently checking my wristwatch the audience i saw it with left the theater in silence a better bet see the movie legally blonde dave
i would put death wish in the same box as stallone s cobra and commando the box that i would sell for at a garage sale with all the videos inside the story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies success to ruin it all with this load of trash why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past films with this cheap junk the story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel i mentioned cobra earlier because it has the same mood that one man can kill or gang members without a scratch both this movie and cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 
jp lacks the spielberg touch it s an all out assault on the senses featuring in your face dinosaurs watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell the script is lame it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered also we don t really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they re worth for example william h macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino thugs for our attention and laura dern was especially sympathetic in jp in this film she s barely a blip on the radar screen the whole jp experience was t o o m u c h too much noise too many surprises too many characters dying off too much predictable gratuitous violence word to the wise vote yourself off this island i rated it a for special effects i took off the other points for having absolutely no originality 
did people expect jurassic park to be full of surprises not one moment of it is worth it many elements could easily scare people out of the movies and it s not the dinos tea leoni i think she s a great actress but i m sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie laura dern she s ok but why not be more noticeable in the movie maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil alessandro nivola have you ever heard of something called facial expression fellings emotions he s got to work harder on that sam neil no big deal the soundtrack got to change that record or you get tired of it my applause goes to william h macy a talented actor who i ve never seen playing a bad role unfortunately he can t save the movie nor can the well computer created dinosaurs 
this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of hours of my life from the opening minutes i was ready to leave the cliches there slapping you in the face and the plot was not only predictably stupid but full of more holes than swiss cheese i am considering suing for that lost hours and along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film the t rex s must be flipping in their graves so to speak 
how sad it is when a film as wonderful as jurassic park slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise the newest sequel jurassic park iii has given no thought to characters a story or pretty much a script and instead relies on non stop dinosaur action which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch the dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the technology after years of cgi advancements it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name the introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make go see shrek again 
number was really great summer popcorn fun it was the modern jaws number is best summed up by jeff goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas or something like that number is the obituary notice jp has achieved all it ever will once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie that said movie is ok if you don t mind knowing you already have seen it before 
i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out it didn t bother me that lost world wasn t as intellectual as the original and here i was just hoping for a good monster movie it was all about dinosaurs eat people however it was disappointing even on that level for starters there were not enough people to eat and while i ll keep it a secret how many people get eaten it was not enough also while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community there were not nearly enough dinosaurs and many dinosaurs like the spikey back and has a club on its tail osaurus just made cameos and didn t do much considering how cool they are start spoilers then there were the pterodactyls the figures i ve read put their body weight at about pounds while the movie made them look closer to worse they didn t get to eat anybody or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up there was no ending to the movie either it was just all of the sudden credits end spoilers i m left wondering if the edition i saw was missing minutes of film my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your go rent the carnosaur series at least you won t be disappointed 
to summarize my group of friends and i spent about minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint even the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls we got several brief shots of the new species and only really were involved in the action as a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but logically formed i e how they built the dinos in and malcom s chaos ramblings was disappointing as well in short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money i hope that movie goers don t fall for this trap again although i did apparently 
 a possible minor spoiler the first jurassic park was an effective but silly film that did it s job and was actually pretty good the sequel the lost world had a few decent moments but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a t rex running amok in san diego now in jurassic park iii what little story there was in the first one and the sequel has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere minutes of basically non stop action which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done sam neill is back as dr grant who is given a proposition by a couple william h macy tea leoni to come with them to an island to help them find their son who s been lost for over months but of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them this one was obviously intended as a thrill ride with no real story whatsoever but even on that level the movie doesn t deliver director joe johnston jumanji somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the jurassic movies and squeeze the life right out of it the dinos look okay though by now they re just standard fair and not very scary the bottom line is it s not a very good film even as a thrill ride out of stars 
it s clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters but immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters the fly over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon the all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from jp and the story line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it s entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated this gave me with no option but to award the film 
this would probably be a good film to see provided you ve already seen every other film in existence and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you god this movie was unbelievably insipid with some of the worst or is it nonexistent writing ever captured on film there is no saving grace to this film even the animatronics are kind of lame and it s just a complete waste of time and money run fast it s beyond horrible 
i was disappointed with the third film in the death wish series and wouldn t recommend this unless you are really into bronson he is his usual self in this one maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t v the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a team but not on the big screen even if it is an action movie that doesn t claim to be anything to sophisticated the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness the plot is something out of an episode of highway to heaven and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don t even get any satisfaction from bronson s revenge against the bad guys skip this and go on to the th installment which i highly recommend 
you could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie the first one had an original story the second stole one from king kong and in the end i hope of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives that was about all there was to it the special effects were decent but not worth dollars if you have a discount theatre in your local area wait and see it for a buck i wouldn t even bother renting it that would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller 
when i went to see this i thought i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also wrong there was no suspense and they don t explain about the new dinosaurs when i was done watching this i had lost all respect for steven spielberg and michael crichton but then it turned out that it wasn t directed by spielberg or written by michael crichton this movie was going through the motions i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it 
how could anyone who liked the previous jp movies even stand to sit through this hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film it s mind boggling i remember when i went to see jp as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the sfx the music the direction all fantastic jp in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor please but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience but the the third one has no point it s supposed to be a sequel that carry s on from jp and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous films for example the new mega spinosaurus seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape it s presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous movies was and always will be the t rex so what does the d urr irector joe johnston go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge t rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new dino on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and don t get me started on the whole satellite phone in the dino belly thing just when you start to get over how stupid the spinosaurus is you see the raptors aside from their new punk haircuts they seem pretty credible phew they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second are wait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing surly they should have grown opposable thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because it s getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic jp is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague
i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women every episode their is always more white women then black one s as if to say white women are better looking then black women i would like for once see more black women then white and it not just your show it s like that in a lot of shows always more white s but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice you are just a big fony hypocrite 
tyra the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don t care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something weird locations too much makeup too much skin is not necessary sex does not always sell when you are selling to women the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural people come in all shapes sizes they need to have that on the show my daughter has a inseam is tall slender a size i am more average at a size we would like to see both i can not picture how something would look on me when a size is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes thank you 
in watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind one wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition no other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so but as the series goes on and on i ve come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill women shouldn t watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they re doing book reports on the subject many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model they live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim you will see me again heck i m trying to see what happened to the ones that did win actually this is the dream of some girls and good for them in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way like to college i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose so of course that would make them look even fatter a ploy fashionatas use all the time bad bad tyra and crew but to be fair americas next top model is not about full figured models it s about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix hence the name of the show hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get but then again that is the one thing i like about this show the ex model giving others who wouldn t have the chance a chance to enter the doors but after that everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program 
tyra banks needs to teach these girls that it s not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls i see tyra less involved with the girls in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr jay manuel recently tyra had a contestant who was a pre op transsexual i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident trannie ms jay to help the girl out instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism it s a shame because i truly enjoyed the first seasons there s a reason why project runway has all seasons out on dvd and top model only has season on dvd it s called taste top model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity 
this is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers san pedro beach bums my wife loves watching reality shows and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a walk the end result was straight out of monty python s ministry of silly walks sketch i couldn t laugh hard enough and then there s the ubiquitous ms banks as in laughing all the way to the she has to be the most annoying self important woman on tv since rosie o donnell left the view as if modeling was doing great things for mankind please i ve never found her attractive and i don t find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women 
it was awful plain and simple what was their message where was the movie going with this it has all the ingredients of a sub b grade movie from plotless storyline the bad acting to the cheesey slow mo cinematography i d sooner watch a movie i ve already seen like goodfellas a bronx tale even grease there are no likeable characters in the end you just want everyone to die already save hours of your life and skip this one 
wow i think they made this movie to torture people there are no words for how much i hated this film i could have been cleaning my room instead i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but come on 
this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian falangist party or some similar group the strong man kersey places himself above the law but not outside the law and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash the only thing that made me think it wasn t made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group and you ll see what i mean it s a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie 
imagine every stereotypical overacted cliche from every movie and tv show set on the streets of brooklyn between and populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters throw in a mix of period music and wailing electric guitars during the rumble scenes then pass the time trying to figure out or care which of the deuces is going to be killed in the anti climactic final rumble i ll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy teen slasher explosive action movie teen sex comedy kiddie musical or oscar nomination vehicle but bringing something new or interesting to the street gang tragedy genre might ve been nice 
maybe it was the fact that i saw spider man the day before i saw duces wild but i do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was the cast was there to do it but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie the only problem was that they did not fit i did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best i left wondering why i spent my money on this movie 
wow i was really disappointed i wasn t really planning on seeing this movie in the theater and i wish i stuck to that plan it really should be a made for tv movie i was kind of excited to see it as i m a big fan of fairuza balk but this movie didn t do her justice infact i m a little disappointed with the acting all around what a horrible cover up of fairuza balk s tattoos it bothered me every time i saw her shoulder there was no flow to the movie it was very hard to get into it one scene we get angry hyped up we want blood the anticipation rises just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between annie and bobby it would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sectional sunday paper comic strip there was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts the gangster leaders were scrawny guys not very believable matt dillon head of a mobster organization come on give me a break there was just no intimidation there the soundtrack wow i think this is one of the worst musical scores i ve ever heard what awful guitar solos my god the sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends i m sure anyhow there is one positive comment i d like to make about the movie the settings were nicely done i liked the colours a good job conveying that time period 
worst pile of drivel to date everyone involved with this production should be ashamed of themselves not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea a first grader telling you a story about nap time is more entertaining 
in a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the s leon the leader of the deuces starts the gang after his brother od s on junk he vows to protect the neighborhood the leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge the movie didn t really do it for me the good guys weren t any more good than the bad guys very little was shown to suggest that the deuces really cared for the community i suppose the writers were going for realism here but i just didn t care which side won none of the characters were likable or even capable of drawing my sympathy on the plus side the courtship between annie and bobby had some snappy dialog and the acting overall was well done 
 in the sweltering summer of the deuces a gang of brooklyn toughs find their turf threatened when the leader of a rival gang the vipers is released from prison leon stephen dorff the deuces leader tries to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep the vipers out but when his brother brad renfro falls into a sultry and dangerous relationship with annie fairuza balk the sister of a viper and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked leon and his gang are plunged into an all out war to save his brother his girl and his neighborhood according to the dvd sleeve description this is definitely no basketball diaries think of it as west side story getting hit over the head with baseball bats and steel pipes stickball having left brooklyn with the dodgers deuces wild has some cool hollywood sets s cars and soundtrack songs and much of it is nicely photographed by john a alonzo the story and direction never get beyond these strengths which enables the film to peak during its opening minutes and proceed downhill the cast looks good when you read the credits but translates into an ageing flabby mess of phony pompadours blood and brylcreem and one fright wig a sense of sadness and regret permeates the production deuces wild scott kalvert stephen dorff brad renfro fairuza balk frankie muniz
worst movie ever seen worst acting too i cannot imagine a movie worse then this nothing to see no acting at all t hey actors should look for another job i cant t understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie i m sorry for eric roberts must be tough i cannot imagine how huuuge his mortgage must be to justify taking the job the ladies in the movie perhaps they better stick to xxx as for the leading man what a lead he better be put on a lead and stay there i can see him being more successful at barking rather than acting overall rating do not rent do not buy 
eric roberts stars in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards though evil by most people s standards his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with lethal weapon electric prods the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense thomas has clint eastwood s squinter eyes dolph lundgren s one liners the acting abilities of jcvd and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation martin cobra kai kove s career shares this low point with roberts in the film it is difficult to tell if kove s character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if kove just came that way i couldn t blame him if he did fortunately for all involved this movie has a so bad that it s good quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do 
 wasn t perhaps eric roberts best year both raptor and this came out watched raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being erics worst but that had it s share moment of fun and d standard this one doesn t have a thing tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves the two thing that stands out are martin kove and eric roberts you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism i say thank you roberts see you next time and hopefully a better one 
enjoy the opening credits they re the best thing about this second rate but inoffensive time killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove the main part however goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who nevertheless occasionally manages to project a banty rooster kind of belligerence the first time we see him he s bare chested sweaty and engaged in that favorite beefcake activity chopping wood after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in lethal weapon he could use a better script however since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing there s also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained there are a few pluses though sending john woodrow undercover as john wilson is an amusing play on a presidential name and co star jody ross nolan shows promise as an inmate who early in the proceedings is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard one final note the movie s low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of extras despite the impressive size of the prison it only seems to hold about inmates note the cast credits at the end aren t too helpful for the record the burly bald headed guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback and the young fair haired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail 
this movie lacked credibility for two reasons one no mayor of a major city and new york is certainly as major as it gets would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security all of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly jewish or defenseless at years of age i have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did even escape from new york which was fictional up front i e they told you that this was science fiction didn t resort to such deep seated violence in this movie most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them also in this movie and i have not seen the prior two is more lawless than the escape movie secondly gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be on the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he s killed yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers the next gang over is welcomed with open arms outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped we are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang the other gangs want to be all into it why did the outside gangs come to help i believe that more than one gang from outside came to help what did they come for another question why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack bronson s character this was not a great movie and i could go on but i won t 
i was looking forward to this movie trustworthy actors interesting plot great atmosphere then if you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life first know it ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire which they almost did things i didn t get a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone oblivious to the consequences great riddles that fell by the wayside the promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so called criminal i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian pauls role crucial and penetrating and then basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last minutes or so what run out of ideas such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road
when the legends die is a powerful moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull a champion bronc rider raised in the old ways tom is given a white man s name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world bitter about the role he has been forced into tom finds fulfillment doing one thing busting horses riding them to death in the rodeo the movie has richard widmark in the role of red the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story which is about where the movie ends the real story is completely ignored the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas oh well you should read the book this movie doesn t come close to doing the story justice 
the first half of this film held some promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a low key character psychodrama like the minus man but then the whole thing collapses into cliche and the viewer slowly loses all interest there s a decent cast here but the film is lifeless and the talent completely wasted 
i just watched this today on tv it was on abc s sunday afternoon movie this wasn t a very good movie but for a low budget independent film like this it was okay there is some suspense in it but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down the script is pretty lame and the plot elements aren t very realistic such as the way a operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder i don t know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea but it isn t very realistic i thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good but unfortunately they never did there were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this and in the end didn t prove to be very creative if there is something good about this movie it is the cast every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with the terribly underrated actress elizabeth pena was great in this movie she is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice however if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good watch the excellent animated movie the incredibles in that movie she put her sexy voice to good use what can i say this movie isn t really worth your time but the actors were good unfortunately they were all wasted on this movie which is a real shame this movie tried to be a good suspense thriller but in the end it fell flat if you want to see a good movie that is similar to this but much better see the hitcher if you want to see something with the cast members of this movie watch any of their other movies you can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it 
horrible acting with the worst special f x i ve ever bore witness too it s bad enough i wasted to watch this crummy pile of crap but it s the hour and a half time i lost that i could ve been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty getting drunk couldn t even help this video to put it bluntly i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind numbing work perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if it s written directed and produced by the same person and never ever expect anything of value from jeff fahey 
this film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department awful awful awful it s only around eighty minutes long but believe me you ll feel like you re watching an andy warhol film then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting where to start the putrid script the disgusting cinematography the so bad its bad acting the spectacularly dismal effects dreadful music or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve this film is an incoherent shambles a particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when dominic pinon decides to shoot a cat cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average english accent god damn to right that woman god damn this horrendous monstrosity everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again 
ok the box look interesting the opening have great music and its kinda original to that its all ok but when the movie start well its not my first videoville movie i watched ghost lake and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here the story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student with specials effect that me laugh the blood look like a mix of red and white paint the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop all the movie is shot in day very great for a movie supposed to be horror and there like no gore scene only and it look so home made and not credible and near no blood it can be considered a great thing considering the look of the blood show and demon for the whole movie the story is going nowhere it give you the impression that it never start there so much useless scene done only to give the movie the average duration time when the demon search the guy in the dogs thing for about minutes way too much slow mo things well lets just say this movie is a z series one and a very poor one all cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie it bored my all long and i m not the guy who get bored very easily with horror movie man i even like house of the dead and alone in the dark from uwe boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst director but here it look too much like some guys wanting to make a movie for fun plus for us french speaker tough i understand english i prefer to watch movie in my native language there the usual videoville bad translation in normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking you have to check on lips etc here you just have to listen to it and you know it very cheesy
from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film lets put it this way i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought i can do better than that whilst sat watching this pap the acting in this film was terrible i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from aliens was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place the storyline was mediocre and i suppose like most films if the rest had been done well it would have stood up i don t usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating must be cast crew i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack 
ok it was a risky move to rent this flick but i thought i had nothing to lose well i was wrong this is next to bloodsurf the worst horrormovie i have ever seen crappy actors crappy technical output crappy story and so on the soundtrack though isn t to bad that is why i give it a on the vote and not just a and of course the cats are a positive surprise by far the superior actors in this movie do not rent or buy it stay away from it and hope that this horrible horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a cult classic it most definitely do not deserve any recognition 
 spoilers i m going to be as kind as i can about this film some people including directors can get quite upset when reviewers speak their mind so there is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and that s it everything else bites the big one all the acting is appalling the script is embarrassing the special effects look like they were done by school children on cheap computers all in all this film has serious bowling shoe tendencies as a horror film it s not very scary and if it supposed to a thinking man s horror film well it succeeded on some level i kept thinking that the end of this film is an awfully long way away it may actually be an ironic look at bad horror films and i m missing the point but i somehow doubt it this is a complete car phone warehouse of a film and i could not recommend it to anyone and it does pain me to say this as i eagerly await the resurrection of british horror if you don t agree with this review that fine it s just my own opinion and i m sure someone out there will love it the director s mum for instance 
well i ll begin with this i love horror movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homage however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of c movie crap from and up i know you re joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you can t be for real everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so i ll leave it minor spoiler alert but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me 
this is slightly less sickening than the first two films but otherwise it s business as usual a scuzzy sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema charles bronson is back blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood crime you see is up in the south belmont area so what s to be done a stronger police presence tougher jails harsher sentences nope the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge or as the writers would have it justice this time he s the personal killing machine of police chief ed lauter the writers bend over backwards to make kersey the hero sending the useless cops into the area only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection and supplying a scene in which kersey has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back to applause from the watching crowd capital punishment for theft well okay the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution and the dishonest twisting of the characters into ciphers who exist only to cheer kersey on or back him up is appalling sure these villains are scum but shouldn t the film leave the audience to make up its mind rather than slanting the entire thing towards kersey and his mindless answer funnily enough the beleaguered residents don t fear gang reprisals or blame kersey for any of the violence which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of kersey s involvement at the end of the film they all take guns from their sock drawers and gleefully join in with the massacre never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being the atrociously shallow performances don t help bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can t even put inflection on the right words new heights of stupidity are reached here a machine gun a rocket launcher and new lows of misogyny the movie contrives to desecrate every female character in sight whether by rape explosion or throat slashing and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion like one victim who ventures into the crime ridden gang controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger or another who goes shopping alone at night this is dreck pure and simple mindless garbage put together without style or sense 
this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the cast is an international one australian pretending to be british stage american and a character with an english name sporting an unrecognizable european accent what passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity so short were the shoestrings of this film s budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk n slash thrillers of extraordinary though not necessarily high quality which have been made on no budget at all recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary blair witch project and of course the most recent that low budget winner saw featuring practically unknown leads gary elwes is just someone you don t remember even if you have seen him before in darkhunters it is shocking to find a known character actor dominique pinon and hollywood has been jeff fahey struggling valiantly to save the film it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man fahey in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines i would have rated this film out of had that been possible 
where on earth do i start with the mess that is darkhunters firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or tv screen and can only be described as a poorly judged stephen king rip off at one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter jack claims that carol the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing is as annoying as a gherkin in a burger i would be laughing if i was making it up but i m not just as ludicrous is how carol originally came to have the power to see how people die a cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid what secondly for a horror movie it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever this may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark broad daylight not very atmospheric at all thirdly the acting is truly awful pinion proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable jeff fahey is obviously on auto pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe ful humphry bogart impersonation as barlow marlowe barlow we get the joke it just isn t funny credit should go to susan paterno an actress i was not aware of she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other more experienced actors to shame at no point is it even explained how the human character can understand what van husen s character is saying to her she obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages on the plus side one moment is well done the car crash involving susan the sfx are throughly believable and if it weren t for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded all i can say about darkhunters is that british horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown avoid this movie like the plague although the plague would be a lot more scary darkhunters p s the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious it is a weak defence when some claim you didn t like it because you didn t understand it the letters after my name make a fool of you not me 
hey guys and girls don t ever rent or may god forbid buy this piece of garbage i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were and in the grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings in fact we would have been taken up to evaluation for the oscars if we were to be compared to the actors in darkhunters the story is terrible the makeup is terrible the filming is terrible the set is terrible the directing is terrible etc i can t actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film maybe except all the cats which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute please use your money on other things than on this film i couldn t even see the last minutes of the film it was that terrible if anyone really liked this film i would really like to hear from you and i will try to see if i can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist s office near you out of actually below if possible not worth the dvd or tape it is on 
i don t even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie i mean really you got this guy running from a bunch of cats because he s dead but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them and they leave a corpse even though normal people can t see them because their dead the script already has a hole in it the size of nebraska then you have the main character played by susan paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot it s absolutely horrendous and i don t even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever they might as well have called this movie the little movie that could choo choo ka choo 
it s a shame there s an interesting idea here but it gets completely lost in a confusion of commodore style computer effects and bad storytelling the plot such as it is concerns a bounty hunter of souls it should be a fairly straightforward hunter hunted kind of story but the director and or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting things aren t helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he s wearing a cheap darth maul mask which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors not much to recommend here even the title seems to propel it into obscurity 
at what point does a film become so bad it s good compelling in it s awfulness darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c p cinematography and for that alone probably deserves some kind of award the plot revolves around the age old battle of heaven and hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead in the case of darkhunters the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats a hooded grim reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire a philip marlowe a like with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on day release from kwik save the protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely a boarding kennels in an attempt to evade his pursuers the plot is spread thinner than a dieter s sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense the acting is laughable comparable to a school play although that would be an insult to many educational establishments and the dialogue oh how my sides ached with the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as life s unwanted gherkins by the flame glow demon you wonder whether hell really is a mcdonalds but is is bizarrely compelling you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get at just over minutes it s worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles 
it s hard and i didn t expect it but it s really the worst film me and my wife saw awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time the storytelling doesn t follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess the action and the dialogs appear at jumps the thing that disappointed me most was to see dominique pinon one of my french favorite actors involved in this uh i don t even know how to describe it without being polite the rest of the actors where at the most poor susan paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character making a flat inexpressive performance poor special effects i don t think that it was a complete waste of film but it s close to if i m to say i would advise everyone not to see this movie i think it would be a complete waste of time sincerely i never though i would say something like that about a movie but there s always a first time 
this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time it s dull ponderous badly acted and teeth crawlingly pretentious i watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold before realising there wasn t any the shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer space the only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous demons wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket how scary is that and i did like the moggys used as extras i suppose they are least cheap though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna this film is so dreadful it should have a public health warning there was a queue at my local video store when i took it back of people demanding their money back i kid you not 
hm where do i start i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance but this time i wish i d paid attention i know some people liked it and i m not trying to say that they shouldn t it was semi amusing at some parts but if you re like me and you don t like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for minutes random fast motion cloud scenes dogs barking in cages for another minutes set to thrilling music and close ups of faces while people are speaking then you might want to avoid this movie the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top and the film quality was awful fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on but well she doesn t really convince me otherwise in fact i ended up really disliking her crazy character and what was up with the souls in space i understand this is a fantasy movie but come on i will say the angel at the end was freaking creepy it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie way more creepy than the darth maul lava face demon i give them props for that scene it was good but not good enough to actually see the movie and the opening credits were great but don t be fooled i would ve rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better bah i wish i hadn t bought this for even the that i paid for it i could have bought a candy bar instead 
first of all i really can t understand how some people enjoyed this movie it s the worst thing i have ever seen even the actors seem to be bored and i think that says it all however i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators that team seems to have a really good future that s why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits and one or two special effects sequences if they re watched outside this movie it almost looks like a good movie better luck or judgment next time for the producers of this this this thing 
 death wish is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery all the characters apart from bronson s paul kersey of course exist merely to be killed either as provocation the good guys or as retribution the villains the director simply pours on the mindless violence people even get burned alive and blown up turning this into an urban version of commando and charlie like arnold rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire fans of this short of thing and apparently there are many will enjoy it others beware 
this movie really is that bad and i m normally a sucker for bad movies but this was too much seeing this is like od ing on pure suck now you may think you ve seen the bottom of the barrel you may have waded through every title from full moon and troma all the movies of edward d wood jr uwe boll albert pyun and direct to dvd flicks from faded men of action you may even have seen death tunnel ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst k covered but in their original form but you do not know truly awful film making until you have seen darkhunters and if you haven t you shouldn t don t bother not only is this movie amazingly poorly written directed shot edited acted and splattered in crude cheap aftereffects first of all it s a pretentious mess but not good greenaway or lynch style pretentious or hilariously messy in an ittenbach or early waters sort of fashion it s the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they ve come up with something incredibly smart sort of like m night shaymalan sp only that man seems like a freakin messiah when compared to this trainwreck and this coming from a rampant shaymalan hater it s also boring not heavy going type boring which is okay if the movie awards your patience darkhunters does no such thing it s boring in a oh my fu king god if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu king kill myself kind of way btw anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed 
i cant go for long describing this tittle simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that s all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid p s out of the viewers must be going crazy i cant go for long describing this tittle simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that s all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid p s out of the viewers must be going crazy
this is arguably the worst of the major ava gardner films yes she is gorgeous but that can wear thin over time especially after the corny and predictable movie ending in this turkey robert walker has to pretend that he s eddie bracken which surely embarrassed him olga san juan plays the jane powell golly gee part dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick and eve arden plays helen broderick and a host of other wise cracking female semi comedians yes the film contains a major popular song speak low but check out the other entirely forgettable pieces dick haymes sings very well of course and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava the sets are cheap the script is filled with clich s and failed humor and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor as indeed he was in short if you want to see ava in her prime buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie 
i ll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time boy was i wrong and disappointed one touch of venus which starred mary martin kenny baker and john boles on broadway ran for performances in the season and gardner walker and tom conway play the roles that martin baker and boles did on stage the kurt weill ogden nash musical with book by nash and s j perelman was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who reestablished herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood look at the names that went into this show given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay it was like all the wit was drained out of it doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway but it s even too much for eve the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner of course when the statue goes missing conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker the last person to be with the statue the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them for reasons i don t understand ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines the singing is carried by dick haymes and olga san juan playing walker s friends and coworkers of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker you would kind of think that haymes would be playing walker s role at least it was awkward to say the least only three songs survived from the score don t look now but my heart is showing that s him and the incomparable speak low haymes s silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century ogden nash were done over by ann ronnell i suspect the infamous code was at work here in lee server s biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man howard duff when duff and gardner reunited walker took it badly and didn t speak at all to gardner off camera i m sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn t help matters either hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you ll get to see it the way weill nash and perelman wrote it 
when na ve young eddie hatch a window dresser at savory s department store falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first rate songs the purpose was to make a safe popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner s upward mobility to super stardom robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role eddie s not just naive but dithering and hapless gardner is gorgeous but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie s loving but jealous girl friend tom conway as the suave owner of savory s and eve arden as savory s long time wise cracking secretary it s a role arden could play in her sleep and she s good at it the musical opened on broadway in and made mary martin a big time star the only point of a musical however is to have music since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts kurt weill composing and ogden nash writing the lyrics came up with a series of stylish witty songs and one masterpiece without the satire or the clever songs or martin or an equivalent showstopper the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill nash songs they brought in the movie s music director ann ronell to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived turning sharp observation into lovey dovey romance ronell was no hack she wrote willow weep for me wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash s clever work the one bright spot in the movie is that weill nash masterpiece speak low is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote it s given one of those ultra professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner dick haymes contributes a chorus as for ann ronell she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director as well as composer and lyric writer yours for a song the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business including ronell kay swift dorothy fields and dana suess and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast you might be able to track down the cd one touch of venus original cast lute song original cast the music is paired with lute song another broadway show that starred martin 
i enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious rh however was a re hash of the first two without the charm or humor i think i may have laughed once and it was during the ngs tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film and his character didn t seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible chan is always likable but he seemed tired in this film i was able to predict everything who the villain was who the girl was spoiler alert who the good guy turned bad guy was etc i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate endeavors but not in any more rush hour sequels it s just too tired i recommend a rental but not a purchase 
for a series that was inspired by kolchak it s ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it s ass has always puzzled me and at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller i ve often wondered if i m missing the point the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don t match the box and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires who ll drink my blood while listening to busted but that s a risk i m willing to take i ve always been a werewolf man myself 
you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting but it s far from that take the concept for example the main character s have a big secret that they hide from they re peers it s just like hannah montana and that s so raven next the acting is just average selena gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes lastly the jokes are either clich or boring if they re not using they re colorful yet strange dialog to make us laugh they are throwing various props around the room i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material in conclusion wisards of waverly place is a disappointment 
if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris more shallow than britney more vapid than jessica and more narcissistic than the girls next door wonder no more the amazing thing is selena gomez is apparently supposed to be the heroine she s also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled shallow vapid narcissistic popular girls at school which is no more believable here than it was for hilary duff in lizzie mcguire plots range from recycled bewitched i dream of jeannie to parodies of harry potter the older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces the younger boy is just another of the smart mouth wisecracking brats who have multiplied on tv like cockroaches in new york and with the same appeal the dad is the stereotypical dumb tv dad and the mom well she s not totally awful but all pales beside the hideous loathsome and yet horribly fascinating like a bad car accident spectacle of ms lopez smug self satisfied snotty performance and again she s the heroine 
i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show it is so boring the jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny it s like alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there s a laughing sound background my friend and i just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other what s so funny seriously every time we watched that show you wouldn t hear any laughing or coughing just a blank look so we stop watching it i am personally a fan of sitcoms so i tried to watch the show but the show us such a disappointment this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever 
ok i just flipped channels and caught dw i watched it knowing it would be trash but as a person who has seen tons of films this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen i m not kidding it is so bad you have to watch it like a bad accident you can t turn away from sometimes these kinds of films work ie troma movies but watching martin balsam and charles bronson slum it up like this is painful what s even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a i can t believe it made it past equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series somehow this garbage warranted part and and to top it all off some dude s comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time statements like that scare me about this world 
this is what disney channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts it suits them well it s not funny the acting is the worst i ve seen in many years there are more stereotypes than there are actors and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes wanna know why not only is this show a waste of airtime the lead actress selena gomez looks like a pig jake t austin s character needs some ritalin david henrie s character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted also the writer of the show is inconsistent in one episode the security guard is called sir by one character and referred to as a woman by all else hello it s called proofreading and editing do it sometime disney has anyone seen the promo for the new four part bloodsucking saga disney wanted their own version of the twilight vs harry potter thing except a million times lamer the wizards of waverly place movie think about it for a minute family goes away on vacation and year old daughter wants independence from parents same plot from the proud family movie etc what s worse is all the emmies and alma s it got and most of the audience are some what age s and no life teenagers how many more years before selena gomez is showing her tits and disney shows are all crap hack writers hack shows destroying the minds and wallets of today s youth 
the affair is a very bad tv movie from the s starring the then husband wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers she has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer he s an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this wood s jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed no matter what and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick she sings it for four or five or six minutes so you know it s classic padding between commercials it also is one of the worst songs ever written and the woman doing wood s singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery also keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses by comparison wagner looks relatively timeless with close cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits 
natalie wood portrays courtney patterson a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair with her partner being attorney marcus simon played tepidly by wood s real life husband robert wagner the film is cut heavily but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently somnambulate laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood who also proffers a fine soprano the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner s dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood which must be discouraging to an actress the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this coupled with choppy editing leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing although largely undistinguished the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and following the sound of a closing door remains at the center while the camera s eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty more controlled direction would have allowed the performers even the limp wagner to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship as it was released there is for the most part an immense lack of commitment 
describing this film is a difficult task on the one hand it s an over the top vampire spookfest complete with cobwebs eerie music a hypnotic medallion and of course a coffin with a creaky lid on the other hand this is one of the silliest scripts this side of edward d wood jr produced by the same people who gave us the bloody vampire invasion of the vampires and this film s predecessor the modestly titled the vampire the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films as i mentioned this film is a sequel to the vampire which i have not seen but no matter it s real easy to imagine what happened dr enrique played by abel the brainiac salazar is befuddled when the well intentioned but misguided dr marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy count karol de lavud i suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counts of some sort dr marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies and he hopes to use the vampire s corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire s lack of a normal reflection at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection we see the vampire s skeleton enrique is not pleased and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition this man was no vampire i ll admit that he liked to drink a little blood but that s all he states also confusing matters is the fragile martha a part time nurse and part time showgirl who happens to be enrique s object of affection martha narrowly escaped de lavud s clutches in the first film and apparently enrique has spent a great deal of time healing her mind and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real ok so if you were the scriptwriter for this film you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire right well how about the greedy con man who helped marion steal the coffin after getting a glimpse de lavud s body he sets his sights on the expensive looking brooch that the count is wearing and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren t looking but darn it he can t remove the brooch because of the stake so you guessed it de lavud is on the loose again this time with the shady con as his human henchman ok so of course the vampire is after martha again and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe at first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all points bulletin out for a man who is dead but still alive you can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists one of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum is there any other kind in these types of films complete with a fully equipped torture chamber with real torture and execution equipment the movie has a very keen sense of style and not just in the campy cobwebs one effectively creepy sequence has de lavud chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a german expressionist nightmare the cabinet of dr caligari seems to be an influence but the rest of the film is juvenile particularly in the film s climax the special effects are quite crude even for the year that this was made and the climactic fight with de lavud in bat form is laughable enough but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray right at that very minute what an unfortunate coincidence to make matters worse he cuts away from the fraying rope to scenes of enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat basically standing still and waving his arms around it s definitely an ed wood moment if ever there was one especially when martha seems to revive on her own and rises groggily to her feet just as the blade slams down whew what a relief in terms of kookiness the vampire s coffin does not have the lunacy factor of the bloody vampire or invasion of the vampires but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to count for something haw haw 
imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you where is the absolute last place you want to hide i d say inside the uncanny virgin of nuremberg torture device because there s a good risk you ll get brutally spiked to death and yet the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin the vampire s coffin is a rather disappointing sequel as director fernando m ndez doesn t re create the gothic atmosphere of the original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs no more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights the story opens inside count de lavud s final resting place where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart and the vampire count comes to live again immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work the vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic and it s up to dr enrique sald var to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker the vampire s coffin uses a limited amount of locations and there s very little action the whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren t for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances the photography is amazing though with the sublime use of shadows and darkness this is most notably during the scene in which count de lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night it s the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film the rest is fairly mediocre and d j vu 
ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie but this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason furthermore many changes have made the story illogical a few examples in the movie paul renauld really meets poriot before he dies in the book poirot only gets a letter telling him he is afraid to be killed this is completely stupid because if renaulds plan would have succeeded poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been renauld poirot was in the morgue when mrs renauld identified the victim the movie has combined two persons into one cinderella has been removed by the movie the girl hastings falls in love with and the ex girlfriend of jack renauld are one person in the movie why for god s sake hastings finds the victims cause he is such a bad golf player totally unfunny and stupid the movie tells secrets much too early for example at the very beginning so you know things you shouldn t know the murderer gets shot at the end by a person who doesn t exists in the book perhaps because the person cinderella who stops the murderer does not exists in the movie the book is very complex the movie takes only about minutes sure it is difficult to include all the necessary details but it is impossible if you include stupid things which were not in the book and have no meaning e g bicycle race 
oh f cking hell where should i start first of all this show is just another stupid american non funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor the american way of laughing track business makes the whole thing even worse how come i can hear laughter yet there s nothing funny happening pretty stupid eh this show is only for those american people who haven t ever heard that there are far more funnier better and wittier comedies not only in great brittain but also in america the simpsons for example i simply can t understand what is so good about reba that it has lasted for long a while in television it has nothing new to offer it underestimates the possible viewers in so many ways and it simply isn t funny at all i could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as reba but why the hell they had to run it here in finland if i see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me take my word and believe me this show sucks ass even more than these kind of american comedies usually does this is simply horrible do yourself a favor don t ever watch this peace of sh t well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better thanks for your possible interest 
my parents may enjoy this show but i fail to find the humor in it what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team absolutely nothing it s a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays blame that on shows like the dating game and the newlywed game bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid s sure the series has its touching moments still that s no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series this is nothing like the family oriented days of i love lucy some five decades before an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channel s brass think women can relate to reba s character i absolutely dislike the character of reba hart s daughter kyra she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager funny i wonder if the actress who played kyra scarlett pomers is like that in real life away from acting who plays the blockhead ex husband dentist christopher rich is not much better barbara jean played by melissa peterman is ditsy in herself the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoying something else that baffles me is why the dingbat of a series creator allison m gibson decided to set the series in where i live miles away from houston texas reba mcentire isn t even from this state she s an oklahoman why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it but the melodies are basically tuneless 
reba is a very dumb show you can predict pretty much anything that s about to happen barbra jean is just too stupid it s like she s not even a character a show like this should at least have someone who resembles a real life person i guess barbra jean represents a retarded person keira or whatever her name is reba brock they re all stupid keira is like the smartest person on the show and she s still stupid everyone is stupid that s my opinion on reba since i have said all i can say about this show i ll just take up the next few lines of text by saying what i am currently saying right now and do it until there s lines there reba gets 
reba is without a doubt one of the worst comedy series ever i wonder how come there are people writing good comments on reba you watch friends married wtih children fraizer if you laugh at that you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever the actors actresses beside reba are ok so i feel bad for them stucking in a so called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world reba to sum up i suggest this tv show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
naked deanna troi richie s brother chuck from happy days with a reverse mohawk death wish has all this and more including one clever scene where chuck bronson s character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away all i can say about death wish is that it is one of most incomprehensible serious movies that i have ever seen loaded to the hilt with mayhem and nearly zero police response despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score as i understand it bronson disowned this film but happily cashed the check from golan globus if you enjoy quality movies avoid this one but if you re in for a cheap jackass kind of thrill check it out 
reba sucks it sucks hard it s about this awful country singer attempting comedy they might as well call this show generic because that s what it is it s dumb and generic reba you re not funny and i m glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck and so does brock barbra jean the red headed teenager that jockey guy and the year old who got knocked up you all suck and none of you are funny oh and i heard a rumor that reba is actually a gay devil worshipper who idolizes hitler and tortures animals and she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her music in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves but it was just a rumor anyway this is the worst show ever reba is gay i do not like her i think the office is better than this show and this show sucks 
this really is an okay series everyone in it is pretty good but i just can t take reba she s trying to be funny but she just isn t and then she got a stupid accent if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day i have been watching the show in min now and as i said before reba is destroying the show however the year old guy dont know his name but he s soooo funny and he s really saving it all so here s the recipe to get a great show kick reba of it and then put the year old guy into the lead role i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks like me that they should kick reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role
i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too like a spoof of his former self and kyra walks around sneering and being miserable the first to seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba towards the end its pretty bleak in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb reba is being mean to her but poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in barabara jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential 
does anyone else think that reba is basically a ripoff of roseanne just look at the characters from the two families connors roseanne and harts reba the blonde bombshell elder daughter becky connor and cheyenne hart who s married to a moron mark healy and van montgomery the sarcastic brunette younger daughter darlene connor and kyra hart the little brother dj connor and jake hart and the quirky relative jackie connor and barbara jean booker hart and then of course there is the biggest similarity reba hart and roseanne connor reba tried to copy the sarcastic and tough love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as roseanne had or perhaps they made her too lovable for reba hart seems to waver between being mean and scary hence van s line to his wife cheyenne i m not afraid of you i m afraid of your mother and being sweet and caring with little transition in between roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind since she was always mean and sarcastic and whenever she tried to open up it was hard for her as inconsistent as reba s character is it s hard for her to be believable but even if the characters weren t completely ripped off of roseanne nothing could ve saved the show from being sub par in the plot area the writers try to give the show substance but they really can t lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact and you d better believe the jokes are corny it s as if they were written by a twelve year old who thinks that any joke is hilarious while occasionally they come out with something that s funny i don t pretend that i didn t laugh at a few episodes these gems are too few and far between to make reba witty overall reba is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of roseanne sub par plots and sub sub par humor and let s face it terrible acting the show might be a bit better actually if they replaced all the actors especially reba herself who is more community theater quality than prime time sitcom quality i give it a out of just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in 
this show is made for persons with iq lower than the jokes in the show are so lame if you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage you will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform it really pisses me of that viewers gave reba on their voting sure i knew there are some people with iq lower than but what i did not know that there are so many of them so people if you got to read this i hope that you will never ever download or buy this peace of garbage i know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini series scrubs 
while it would be easy and accurate to go into why reba is at its heart indicative of many family oriented sitcoms in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms the real truth is that the show is repetitive full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows and the lead star is completely out of her element while i m sure ms mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next lucille ball is far far removed from reality reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put upon woman of which her entire family is centered yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be mia reba mcintire has no screen presence and to make a show around her seems very short sighted and indicative of most family oriented programming to push a sitcom full of men stupid women do everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can t afford cable the show is a waste of time the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoff just 
in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash however the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band i recognized the music as being a band called firstryke and the album was just a nightmare and it was very well written and i am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it if can remember back that far i would appreciate the feed back i collect old movie and obscure movie sound tracks it is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album not to bad hugh 
now i ve seen it all just when i thought it couldn t get any more pathetic and cheesy than woodchipper massacre just when i thought dialogue and acting couldn t get worse than nail gun massacre just when i thought don t go in the woods would retain its title as lousiest slasher film ever along comes the last slumber party somehow this cheap wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness but it remains terrible i couldn t believe my eyes for once i can t complain about excessive or in this case any nudity in a slasher film but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it never before have i seen such horrible acting dialect direction writing i could go on forever with this list here s a quick run down a mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin dresses up like a surgeon somehow finds out where his doctor lives and breaks in while the doctor s daughter is having friends over for the night then begins the most stupid killing spree ripped off from other movies such as slumber party massacre and halloween this side of the universe the characters have negative iqs which suggests they are not human then again i guess they are not since they have the tendency to bleed kool aid when they get cut as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his scapel to the camera in way too many scenes it is only minutes how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie which i suppose wouldn t be all that bad of an idea in this case there is one moment where i thought maybe just maybe the director would make it interesting a second killer was added but alas it was not to be and then to insult even further there is a stupid super cop out sub ending and an even stupider final conclusion that probably doesn t make a whole lot of sense but i would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools like me dumb enough to rent this sewage i sure hope that by writing this i have saved minutes of someone s life i get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this please please please don t this is a fan of the slasher genre talking i know what is good for you the only real victims in this rattlebrained asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank zanatos s score since there is no negative point scale i have to give it a but a below average at that avoid it at all costs please 
i would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen it s not just the actors that are bad but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about minutes at a time anyone that likes this must be crazy this movie is a waste of time
i thought godzilla was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity my friends and i went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie we could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created we decided to look in the low budget horror section we looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women we finally decided on last slumber party the whoops we made a mistake it seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in k mart the actors were picked up at a salvation army and as for steven tyler we will just leave that to the imagination the plot of this movie was ridiculous spoiler alert while watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all then come to find out all the events were just a dream this movie should also have been about minutes if all the camera zooms on still shots and scans of walls were taken out it would have been much shorter all i can say is i m glad there wasnt a sequel 
the rd in the series finds paul kersey bronson turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy i don t know why this movie shoved me into it but somehow it did i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those punks every time he blew one of them away i felt good this movie does not take itself seriously but what if it did there is a good build up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage but as far as acting and plot go it just doesn t measure up if i lived in that neighborhood i would get out as fast as i could but it seems like the people are asking for trouble i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets but there is a limit here folks i had to give it a sure there are good blow em away scenes but that s about it at that time bronson was i m sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson bronson takes the place of a schwarzanegger or stallone in this movie this movie gives you a sense of rejoice the common man can save the neighborhood save the day to sum it up this is far from being the original death wish but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot em up 
so one day i was in the video store looking for a movie i came across this and rented it because it was a film i hadn t seen or even heard of now i like slasher movies in general but this is just abysmal not even good for laughs besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction i have ever come across now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had but not here painful example of home made horror 
i love cheesy horror movies i think dead alive and bad taste are great and i think slumber party massacre ii not even related to this movie are hilarious but this movie absolutely stank i didn t laugh i didn t even enjoy it you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren t even campy the best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill give me a break don t rent this thinking it s related to the slumber party massacre series it s awful and i don t even have a clue how it got any distribution rent it with a fake name and burn it do everyone else the favor 
i m not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established however watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix we can only assume he had a charlie s angels fixation at one time based on that reference we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie s angels run in or but from what i ve read here it was made around you sure couldn t tell that from the poor production values it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class and while by no means would i expect a low budget trash fest like this to be politically correct the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other even so i d still only rank this as the nd worst horror film ever made second only to nail gun massacre 
i got this on a double feature dvd called scream theater and it s no doubt one of the most terrible movies i ve ever seen and i ve seen some really bad ones school s out and of three girls who if they re teenagers i d eat my hat are talking about non stop party so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party meanwhile a psychotic has escaped the local bug house where one girl s father works is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs and sporting wide open eyes i guess that s to show he s bonkers of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house the location of which is apparently common knowledge in the meantime some dumb jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats and that s about it as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background or maybe that s not it but really that s all you need to know unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk you ll find little of interest here and even if you are wasted most of the time you ll still probably find your intelligence insulted out of 
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago and i must say this is the single best movie i have ever seen i mean woah dude we better get some brew before this joint closes and dude linda s not wearin a bra again what poetry woah and it s such a wonderfuly original movie too i mean you don t usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same i mean exactly now that s originality and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close ups of the psycho in the er scrubs how cool the acting is so wonderful to the dad was just brilliant must have studied real dads before filming and how many movies do you find that just don t make any sense not many but this is one of those gems i mean how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside that s really cool overall i d say this is the single greatest film of the genre nay in the world 
o boy was this really bad i saw this on videotape in scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog when people were on the telephone it was hard to hear the person on the other end it appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits and there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn t seem intentional one indicator of the budget one of many was when a news report comes on tv there is just a news flash title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a tv screen and a voice over by a newscaster they couldn t shoot footage of a newscaster and then actually show it on the tv the movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask wielding a scalpel supposedly he s a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him students are let out of school for a break and three young women decide to have a slumber party three guys decide to crash the party and a geek named science decides to crash it too the slumber party is pretty boring and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks taking the masks off and then disappearing the mother and father the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy of one of the girls keep showing up too the killer knocks slices people s throats without anyone really noticing the apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie perhaps that was bad acting or maybe it was intentional since much of the movie is a nightmare and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare the ending is really horrible too the best thing about the movie is the cheesy united home video vhs box art which was revived for the dvd release a double feature with terror at tenkiller i honestly can t tell if it is a photo or a painting or a combination of both the women pictured on the cover are not in the movie and the clothing they re wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore the throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie where people tend to affect a goofy pop eyed look for that matter that s what the killer has most of the time head cocked and eyes bugging out mugging for the camera frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus while the killer s mask covered face was in close up but out of focus in the background 
oh well its funny should have been a sadistic comedy a lot of horror movies lack common sense but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation don t really expect hitchcock or anything close to this this is a good one for friends but i wouldn t recommend it for anything else this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie the suspense the shock and good characters the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be and he seemed to be the average angry d student able to outsmart only stupid people and the really funny thing is the horrible acting and the lack of emotion of the so called victims just expect this one in the daily funnies 
there are a whole lot of movies primarily from the s that are so terrible that you can t help but love them the last slumber party is one of those i hate this movie so much but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection i have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time it is the prime example of how in the s any movie could get released our killers name is maniac randles scary huh randles is an escaped psychopathic killer running around in doctor s scrubs and a doctor s jacket hacking off people with a scalpel as he goes along he ends up coming across a house of girls that are having a slumber party one of the girls is the daughter of the doctor that tried to operate on randle s and randle s ended up pulling him down in some kind of sexual position lol just watch the movie to know what i am talking about now i know what you must be thinking at this point this must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like slumber party massacre or valentine s day massacre right no this movie is horrible first off the quality of the film changes off and on throughout the film sometimes it will look like it could have been filmed this year but other times it is so grainy and blurry that it isn t even watchable the funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not care at all the director played the killer as if that wasn t funny enough but because of the fact that he wasn t talented enough to act and direct at the same time he just filmed one shot of him walking toward the camera with his scalpel and then just replayed that clip over and over every time someone is killed the characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikable and these people who are suppose to be ages look more like they are i know that slasher films commonly use adults as teenagers but i have never seen a movie where it was this obvious my guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they have all died of old age or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again and that is a good thing because i highly doubt that they could have gotten into any more movies even if they tried all i can do is hope that tyler will one day make the last slumber party the final conflict and have all of the original actors return i m sure everyone would love that the movie was directed by stephen tyler no not the singer who never went on to direct again and it was released by b s which i am sure stands for bull and productions bull s only released one more film forever evil which was pretty awful but not near as bad as last slumber party a horrible horrible horrible film highly recommended 
this one s a doozy dating from scene of the crime often plays more like a coen bros movie set in the s and filmed in black and white except that the writer s ear for pastiche here isn t quite so well tuned maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to oscar baiting schlock like road to perdition frankly it s a wonder that this film isn t considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance much like the grandaddy of all such fake art films citizen kane or anything by murnau mgm is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes and i think any story any atmosphere even gritty realism can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization you could say i m a disciple of the minnelli school but it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough guy dialogue of the dashiell hammett stripe a willingness perhaps to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like careful mr wiggly or you ll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with i made most of that up mr wiggly unfortunately made the cut but believe me the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs even the lead cop s wife played by arlene dahl speaks like she has a moon shaped scar under one eye and the christian name rocco by the time van johnson turns in his badge with the line i m sick to death of death and homicide you ll wonder how the writer s fixation with ornate literary devices in this case zeugma could ever have been misconstrued as street for those who have outgrown the naked gun series this is the funniest cops n robbers film going 
okay now i know where all those boring cop homicide tv shows came from i do believe they can be traced back to this movie scene of the crime feels more like a tv episode or an episode of a serial complete with stock characters and situations the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors the aging cop who doesn t want a desk job despite failing eyesight the reckless rookie the double crossing dame etc i like many of the actors here and they do a good job but overall i found this movie dull as i m not a fan of the genre i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case something about bookies and informers and oh yeah there was a stripper played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven what i want to know is why did she keep calling van johnson uncle wiggly wasn t uncle wiggly a rabbit a character from a children s book what the heck does that have to do with anything i guess i just don t get tough guy film noir ish kinda jargon in fact much of the dialogue made me mutter nobody talks like that however i could relate to one scene where the cop s wife arlene dahl who worries every time he goes to work realizes that maybe she shouldn t have made her husband the center of her life yeah i know that feeling of loving someone so much being so dependent on them that there s a constant fear for their safety so there are moments of truth in this film underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self consciously to be gritty and real that it actually seems unreal to me a little background this movie was made when dore schary took over mgm from louis b mayer and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great dore schary was determined to bring more realism to movies i kinda hate dore schary maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious bleak movies being made today wallowing in the ugly truths about life focusing on and in my opinion helping to perpetuate the worst of humanity rather than the best no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii well damn it we still need that kind of distraction today there s still plenty of depression and plenty of war and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape trashy brain deadening reality tv thanks a lot dore 
since paul kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge the third installment in the death wish saga revolves on him returning to new york to visit an old war buddy he arrives only to find out that brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner conquers the heart of his blond attorney blows away numerous villains with an impressive wildey magnum gun and gradually trains inspires the petrified new yorkers to stand up for themselves okay there s no more point in defending the death wish series after seeing part three the original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and even though it was pure exploitation part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise apparently kersey isn t an architect anymore he s ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody not even the police is against vigilante actions anymore all these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that michael winner and charles bronson reduced their death wish success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier sleazier meaner and a lot harder to kill however the gentlemen didn t seem to realize that the non stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two i once read a brilliant review that referred to death wish as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation this description couldn t be more spot on as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete orgy of gunfire explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures yi haaa this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast including martin balsam psycho angry men as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet ed lauter family plot the longest yard as the slightly unorthodox copper and even alex winter from bill and ted s excellent adventure in his debut role as one of the thugs 
i had seen this movie when i was a boy before wwii and was surprised that the local library had a copy saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was this is an example of a movie that was not a a movie no editing poor script weak acting and not much directing should not even be as high as a b had a laugh at how jaded i ve become over the years seems to me i thought it was good when i originally saw it 
most of wayne s b westerns are kind of fun in a naive way but this one really stinks the editing is terrible and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper and i was bored sorry duke but this gets a 
there were many spooky westerns made in the s and early s and although this has a strong beginning it isn t one randy bowers john wayne stopping at a halfway house saloon finds it to be full of dead bodies the bartender s corpse draped over the bar holding a gun eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture and a player piano playing the loveliest night of the year it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang to get ed rogers randy is an investigator who works alone who wastes little time in getting arrested escaping with ed s daughter sally s help and literally landing in the midst of the black gang s hideout behind a waterfall it all moves along fairly quickly only one too many chases after randy slow it down we even get george hayes clean shaven and playing two parts marvin black the vilest villain as well as the good citizen matt the mute who communicates via handwritten messages having him play two opposite roles was a good idea but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast even for him as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally ah i m fed up with this you can find george playing a vile vile double crossing villain in the serial the lost city i think this is the only lone star film in which the title relates to or is mentioned in the film sally offers her hand to randy and says he s not alone anymore then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake sally s running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff not that bad considering everything but not that great either i d really give it a and a half 
john wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time his career stretched over forty years and within that time he starred in films such as angel and the badman the green berets sands of iwo jima rio bravo north to alaska and the undefeated the film s listed above are hailed as some of his best unlike this effort randy rides alone which has been pretty much forgotten about as time s gone on which is unsurprising as it s nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just minutes a young john wayne plays randy bowers who for reasons never really explained arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed while looking around a posse arrives and finds randy there and they arrest him accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is he is put in jail accused of the murders sally rogers whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered arrives at the jail to see randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place sally doesn t believe that randy is a killer and doesn t recognise him so while the sheriff is out she slips him the keys and randy escapes while running away from the sheriff and his posse randy conveniently stumbles into the gang s hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders randy sets out to clear his name and also to bring the gang to justice randy rides alone can be a fun film to watch especially if you re a john wayne fan but at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore the film is also extremely dated as you would expect we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super fast motion and the dialogue is terrible the acting isn t great either and wayne s character is very wooden and he along with the rest of the cast look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone in this case it s by director harry fraser harry fraser is at the helm and does a good enough job but the story is paper thin one can t help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone an explanation on why randy was there is giving later on which turns out to be something like he is a p i who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town to be honest i didn t really pick it up most of the time i was hoping for the movie to end but that being said i didn t find this film to be completely terrible i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times but it really isn t a great film and isn t really worth watching or tracking down overall randy rides alone is incredibly dated and is a tiresome western with very few redeeming qualities can be fun but overall it isn t a great movie and is certainly one of wayne s weaker outings 
randy bowers john wayne comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to ed rogers proprietor of the establishment he s observed by the dead man s niece sally alberta vaughn from behind a hidden room where she remained unobserved during the carnage randy rides alone was directed by harry fraser he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films where he fast forwards the action from one location to another usually involving a rider on a horse it s pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these s era lone star westerns pre gabby george hayes is on hand sans whiskers and this is the first time i ve seen him as a villain in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role first as hunchbacked businessman matt the mute communicating via pencil and paper only to turn into marvin black leader of a gang of outlaws black s gang was responsible for the murders at half way house in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt marvin another staple player is here as well yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike interestingly yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser wayne oater neath the arizona skies there s a fair amount of time killing horseback riding back and forth between black s gang and the sheriff s posse as john wayne s character maneuvers to expose the bad guys in the end he saves the day by securing sally rogers thirty thousand dollars at the expense of destroying the half way house where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six shooter and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain in his best aw shucks attitude john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers and alas randy rides alone no more 
watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about to minutes or so from the beginning of the story john wayne rides up on this trading post saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies all he sees is the signs of a massacre some dead bodies signs of a fight and no one alive in sight that s because the owner s daughter is hidden in a secret room the kind you find in old english murder mysteries the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes catholic families clinging to the old faith in th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith not something you see in westerns but a good gimmick unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly but this was a b western and not even a good one at that gabby hayes is in this and he s clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film 
this review is for the uk dvd three disc box set disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior chasing jamie and fast and curious disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special falling in lust again and love potion no the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom she s the boss and legally yours why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe lauren hayes reading a letter from a satisfied customer we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines for instance model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel she s the boss is about a put upon male secretary dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised much to her pleasure all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action finally the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel singer island florida although my map of florida shows no singer island the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release stars 
it s long time that i and my wife didn t see such a boring thriller it s definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don t miss anything we gave 
two years after this movie was made the juror came out don t waste your time on this one see the juror instead the juror is essentially the same story as trial by jury with better acting better directing and a far more gripping aura about it william hurt was not believable as a cop gone bad and armand assante couldn t be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit you didn t become involved enough with joann whalley s character to be that upset by what was happening to her also the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn t compelling or interesting in any way kathleen quinlan s role as a hooker killer wasn t fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot 
a antique shop owner in nyc played by joanne whalley valerie alston gets put on a us district court jury on a trial of a known mafioso armand asante rusty pirone and most of this very slow paced film revolves around attempts of pirone attempting to get whalley to acquit him of murder by threatening to kill her son and herself much action ensues involving gruesome mob rub outs interspread with willam hurt as the go between much of this silly disjointed mess surrounds hurt and asante s obsession with whalley courtroom scenes that we ve all seen time and again and an ending that is unbelievable is probably going easy on this waste of time 
the movie is a happy lullaby was made to make us sleep and that s what we do as we dream about the top beautiful natasha henstridge no screenplay no deep characters nothing special so let s sleep 
this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i have seen a lot of movies the unbelievable twist the movie makes going from an extremely bad alien lifeforms inhabit earth movie with sickening bad acting to a film that tries to spread an archchristian judgement day is at hand seek jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell message left me stunned after being tormented for minutes even religious christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this i didn t know what to do with myself when i watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by year olds simply disgusting i am not a christian nor very religious but if i had been i would no longer be afraid of hell rich christiano has shown be something much much worse 
like a lot of the comments above me also i though this was the average scifi movie but unfortunately it was not i found it rather patronizing and indeed preaching but that is not the only comment the scenes are very artificial not as in scifi as i will explain a in a few moments the next sentence is a small spoiler the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other the middle one typically speaking in the worst case the other party is represented by one person also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial sometimes even unprofessional for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters i mean from a point of the interviewed akward moreover the interview persons always stay calm they say everything without normal emotions i e you cannot tell whether they lie or not are mad or not they show almost nothing this is also very unprofessional the christian reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview bottom line all conversations contain facts pro con arguments there are no lies nobody lies the next sentence is a spoiler ignore if you still plan to see the movie the only lie happening is to demonstrate how bad non believers are this makes me conclude that the movie is a b movie it is very similar to plan from outer space from the s but this movie also has an annoying wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief note i have no intention to insult christians people who believe in aliens or whomever else this is a thought i have about the movie not about people moreover i would like to note that i don t know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts 
this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i ve seen in a long time it s marketed as as sci fi when in fact it s nothing more than a christian recruiting tool it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants hypocrites and war mongers let s not forget our bumbling former president actually came out and said that god told him to invade iraq and nobody questioned if he was hearing voices or seeing things anyway going of the subject here no this movie has nothing to do with ufos whatsoever it s nothing more than a religious production 
as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church anyway movie had a good b movie sci fi beginning everything was there to make a good entertaining easy to watch movie then everything felt in this religious jesus will save everyone brainwashing mode story start with main characters reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone s soul with this con descendant attitude in a few words this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about minutes waste of time waste of money avoid it
ok this movie was the worst display i have seen in years the actors weren t to bad i figured it was a b movie so they were doing b movie acting anyways i watched this movie thinking oh cool a ufo sci fi movie wrong it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people the last scene was extremely messed up that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something what someone believe in is a matter of opinion this movie just shows how corrupted religion is especially christianity if you want to watch a b movie this ain t if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses well this is the pick of the litter go right for it if you are going to convey a message do it don t force it ridiculous that people would abuse the media to such a degree especially christians 
this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda it started off like a good sci fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels you will love this movie 
this movie starts really good after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell don t watch it it s pure propaganda and its pure wrong this movie starts really good after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell don t watch it it s pure propaganda and its pure wrong 
my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store from the cover it looked like a science fiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st james was in the film realized it was a christian movie and suggested we watch it we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream nevertheless we decided to give it a screening to be fair there were a few things i liked about the film the musical score much of which was orchestrated was quite good the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower budget movie unfortunately any virtue in this film s production work was lost on a regrettable script the film begins with an interesting premise ufo abductions but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie s two main characters which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture at least the frank peretti inspired the visitation which was itself a deeply flawed film had an endgame that tied together the movie s premise unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdown as for the acting the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful rebecca st james plays a bit part and is passable for their part a few of the main characters are manned capably enough sadly their talents are wasted on characters so one dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable the protagonists are anything but you know it s bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie which will be of more interest to christian than non christian readers in a word it is embarrassing other christian films like carmen s the champion and peretti s the hangman s curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive this film by contrast is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy handed and lacking in tact that a non christian would have a hard time taking it seriously i do believe that the filmmaker s heart is in the right place and i applaud efforts to create good christian film unfortunately this is not one of them if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film consider mercy streets the aforementioned the champion or if you re pentecostal robert duvall s provocative the apostle as for unidentified rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a non christian or a larger audience 
first of all i have nothing against christianity i believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this what a waste of believers money they d better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries i don t want to talk about talk acting or plot of this movie because i couldn t find any of those in this story s simple two reporters one a is atheist the other b for some sake has abandoned religion b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson believe in christ or go to hell this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie people do not believe the rating of this movie read reviews first i didn t and wasted an hour of my life ps why is it classified as sci fi because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky pps u f o satan s evil doings that s a new one 
supposedly a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense it s all a crock some kind of money making racket turns out this movie is actually a deceit and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos one i ve heard before this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology the paranormal it s real just demonic unless it takes place in a christian context then of course it is of god simple if it isn t of god it s the of the devil stupid so i suppose since beethoven s th symphony wasn t inspired by god it must have been written under demonic influence or so would the logic lead ad absurdum we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe therefore there is none a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy and that god created the universe so huge so grand to show us his almighty power i think of carl sagan s remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it d have been a tremendous waste of space so what are ufos they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event the rupture i mean rapture before the tribulation the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic confusion car and plane crashes whatever therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event all part of satan s plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown the strange and the mysterious in as much as possible first by the known if not solely by the known it s like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for i think i d look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away gotten lost or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens or the supernatural or satan or some such this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new as young people are often lured to free rock concerts that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music followed by a sermon and an altar call this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan s ballgame but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes these guys feel that anything goes any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam the world s fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity as islam is far more cohesive and unified and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism although this should offer little advantage to mankind as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascal s wager the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told well if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave no worry but what if you re wrong basically statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default for all we know native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better this movie should be stamped right on the box caution contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes 
director fabio barreto got a strange academy nominea for his last movie o quatrilho quatrilho is a bad movie but in bella donna barreto did one of the worst movies of all time his adaptation of the novel riacho doce is ridiculous think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english in the film they do there isn t a screenplay it s only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with moscovis and henstridge 
this is the third movie in a month i have watched that did not go the way i expected the first two being the black dahlia and hollywoodland neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes i have always had a fascination with ufos and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of ufo investigation that was not a comedy but after about minutes it all went horribly wrong i could have stood for the acting the camera angles the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing ufos but none here i am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter but netflix pushed this movie as a ufo skeptic and a ufo believer investigating multiple sitings i stopped watching about half way thru can t believe i wasted that much time with this one please don t make the same mistake i did 
the only reason i gave this movie a and not a was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out basically i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens any ufo s anything at all suggested by the title of the movie the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was this could have been used to the movie s advantage but i felt instead that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me finally how big was this cast s wardrobe i became so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasn t really supposed to be classified under poor comedy toe thumbs down 
wow just wow there are a lot of reviews on this movie already but i wanted to add some comments of my own i agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing whoo boy does it ever however i think there is some other problems here why is christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive the film acts as though you just can t be a christian and also allow for the possibility why they ever so briefly touch on this in the film i e the bible doesn t say there is aliens well the bible doesn t say there isn t but the actual rebuttal is never answered the bible really doesn t say there isn t so how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite god there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them how come the only two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax what about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences what if it s something else entirely too bad the film makers already have their minds made up the film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult that s a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present i m not necessarily arguing that they don t but if you re going to say something so asinine you d better have the facts to back it up why does the other reporter not the greasy haired blonde guy the other one always have his hands in his pockets it s hard to take someone seriously when they re constantly playing pocket pool i wish this had been an exploration of christian faith and ufo phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their faith message to care much about make a thought provoking movie as a christian myself this saddens me 
i happened across this movie while channel surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly made christian film about the end times which i find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously to be fair i only saw the last minutes so i missed the part about ufos and the sci fi stuff but it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the christian faith as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense as a film the script was terrible the acting was mediocre and the pacing was poor the cinematography and direction were sub par no interesting visuals no layered plot line no creativity don t just blame it on the budget films can still be interesting without special effects this wasn t christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message and the message here was hardly christian disclaimer the rest of this comment is targeted towards christians first off it is unethical in any business to bait and switch your customers i don t like being told i can win a free ipod only to realize i have to spend at participating stores first nonchristians don t like being told they re watching a sci fi film and then get bombarded with christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer hidden agendas don t win you any friends much less converts secondly you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true the actors who represented christians came off as callous smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical unbeliever they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing representational dialogue turn to jesus or go to hell fine don t believe me but you ll be sorry the day you die i can guarantee you ll wish you paid more attention to this jesus stuff when you land in the belly of hell ok i may be exaggerating but it certainly came off in the same manner if you think this is a clear message for christ you re wrong i don t recall jesus using threats and coercion and i don t think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear so christians please don t use this as a witnessing tool for your unsaved friends it is heavy handed offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true christian message thirdly the theology was bad apart from characterizing jesus as a means of hell insurance it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn t attempt to engage the issue of whether ufos or alien life could exist instead it offered one pat answer ufos are the devil s scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most christians as the bible doesn t mention ufos or aliens you can t use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other the rapture isn t necessarily even a widely accepted sound biblical concept though nowadays most evangelical christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series if you do your research as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting the idea of two comings of christ the first as the rapture is a relatively new phenomena in church tradition popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the th century the majority of orthodox christians will probably find this film s message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions basically this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of christianity and its beliefs i wouldn t recommend it 
movies about u f o s are always a nice way to kill some time so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick expecting what can be expected from a direct to dvd u f o mystery boy was i wrong at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the u f o theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda and this is not just a christan movie from an average christian no this is christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind the scary kind in the end of this movie the non believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non believers are left behind when the joke is explained it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer just in case we christians are right now that s a lamest excuse ever to become a christian if you ask me this movie still tries to convert non believers using scare tactics believe in god or you will go to hell is the message here simple but quite offensive really especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different now let s assume you re a christian fundamentalist yourself and you re not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie is this a good movie i m afraid it isn t no actually i m lying i m glad it isn t the acting is horrible the pacing is horrible the plot is horrible especially the ending is laughably bad as soon as the movie starts you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected and you will be right in the first half hour it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u f o mystery but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula look alike that starts babbling about the devil at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac but as it turns out he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie as soon as you start realizing this you know how this is going to end up but actually it ends up worse avoid 
my mom and i rented this movie i mean we love those type of sci fi flicks whether they be big hollywood flicks or indy flicks but oh we were fooled two journalists are investigating a ufo abduction in a small city in texas halfway through all the sudden things get all christain on us my mom and i believe in god and jesus and the devil but the way this movie was preaching it made it annoying all i really have to say is that we are christian but even we like to have fun so don t blame christians as a whole just blame the christians who need to suck the fun out of this movie in fact you can clearly understand the directors stance on ufo s and that is that he believes it is all demonic now i could say some words but i will not all i will say is that do not watch this movie unless you feel like being preached in fact many times it states that we must be perfect in order to enter heaven well last time i checked the only perfect person died on a cross 
im warning you people out there this is just a waste of your time i am being honest when i m saying that this is the worst movie i ve ever seen its just a move about christian propaganda don t throw away your life don t see it i think they made the movie so more people will believe in jesus or something but it works in the opposite way the actors are all newbies the story is just fuzzy i think this movie is a work of the devil this movie is just not worth seeing so please take my advice and don t 
this is the worst movie i have seen to date minutes of utterly bad acting half the cast seem to be suffering from asperger s syndrome ghastly wigs strange make up including tide lines around wig areas and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke one comical aspect of this film if you have the patience to watch it is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts they certainly did not deserve paying with anything else this appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half blending into an equally confused arch christian biblefest in the latter the entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake or at the very least crucified 
this movie was a major bait and switch i rented it because of rebecca st james a popular christian singer i have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a ufo movie well i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend or a friend of a friend my first clue that this movie wasn t what it was supposed to be was when i witnessed the special effects of the ufo encounters cheesy as the movie progressed i noticed how plastic the actors were it was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors there are a few exceptions rebecca was verrryyy disappointing she is always found in the house and doesn t show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the fold doesn t she ever leave the house i had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it i hope that rebecca doesn t believe the message of this movie believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell jesus spread a message of love and hope his message inspired others to change out of love not fear 
after a good start it turned out to be the worst piece of holier than thou propaganda i ve ever seen this movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the holy bible to resume the ok let s call it a plot basically alien don t abduct people that we already know no in fact its demonic forces abducting people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft or read porno magazine as one protagonist does it s complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must blindly follow christ to be saved a quote sums it all imagine a subtle piano music in the background you can t let others even those you love stop you from following the lord and we are supposed to live in an enlightened age still work to do boycott this piece of crap
the dvd for this film is by alpha video a company that almost always releases the poorest quality prints in alpha s defense often that is the only print available but the specialize in public domain and cheap o films if you can find another print by a different company try it first as the print for this film is scratchy and faded still compared to most alpha dvds this one is excellent especially since the sound is pretty clear and alpha never seems to include closed captionings even with films with horrid sound a man has been dating a lady for a very long time one night he s a bad boy and spends the night with another woman soon afterwords he comes clean to his fianc e about this she forgives him and they marry very soon after the wedding he gets a frantic call from the other woman she needs to see him and has just tried to kill herself when they meet he learns that she has an std and she wanted him to know that he too might now have it then although there is a nurse there and they are treating her for the suicide attempt she somehow finds a gun and kills herself the makes a huge mistake he does not tell his doctor and he doesn t tell his new wife some time passes and now she and the baby are infected at this point the doctor meets with the guy and tells him about the importance of getting treatment and they shows him rooms filled with horribly infected people actually these were just films of people with stds that they spliced into the film most of whom have syphilis in some ways the film is very progressive it addresses a serious issue and it s interesting how the film encourages couples not to wait to get married but to marry fast and give in to those sexual urges but only with each other not bad advice at all on the other hand the film never exactly says what it s talking about they never use the terms std vd or the like nor does it even name the diseases often it is referring to syphilis but at other times it s talking about herpes or other stds the information just isn t very clear or specific a very common problem with such films from this era audiences at the time must have felt quite confused about what they were seeing and many of the more naive probably needed to have some of their faster friends explain it all to them speaking of such films in the s s lots of small and often sleazy production companies made films decrying the dangers of drugs and sex though often they really just wanted to promise a bit of cheesecake for audiences who usually could not see such racy fare in hollywood films many of these are hysterically funny since they are so over done and the information so inaccurate the most famous examples are reefer madness and sex madness both by the same two bit production company and compared to how salacious and stupid those two films are this cheap film seems like it should be in the criterion collection interestingly there are weirdos out there i would definitely be included among them that enjoy seeing the films because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are great fun this one however isn t that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims isn t as grotesque as some similar films while the message really should have been more explicit and useful for a film it s pretty good despite the occasionally poor acting and the ludicrous suicide scene remember kids just say no to suicide oh by the way the two years of treatment they talk about in the film was actually the norm for syphilis back in nowadays it s a lot more treatable as are the rest of the stds 
i thought i was going to see a ufo movie instead i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience me make the decision to accept christ in my life or risk going to hell the whole ufo thing was one big red herring the acting in it was pretty pathetic in fact it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members it wasn t real life dialog at all i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn t have wasted my money on it if on the other hand you are into the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views no matter how limiting onto other people then by all means go see it 
i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information score well not so bad genre scifi good i like scifi so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it but but no as in summary this isn t a movie at all it is a religious advertisement including preatching about jesus god devil end of the world etc movie starts with a epic abduction story driving at night car stops bright light and so on well actually that was the film last of this ummm frankly i don t know what to call it was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement quite a same stuff what these tv preachers tell you but they are good at it honestly if you wan t to see a scifi movie or something with ufos please stay far away from this thing it has nothing to do with them if you want to hear some cuckoo head s opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do then go ahead and watch this thing but i still prefer going to the church at sunday this is complete bull and evangelical christian propaganda as another users said well i should have red another users comments before i got the movie of voters have rated this thing as yeah right please go somewhere else to do your propaganda 
christian propaganda lots of fear mongering this is not scifi this is chrifi christian fiction the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn from then on it was all about god jc the holy bible and the devil the ufo s are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe satan s idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible the abductions could be used to explain away the rapture the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien abduction instead of god taking all the christians to heaven no reason to repent if its aliens the deeper message in the movie is that if you don t believe in god and have jc in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose 
this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series i did not know it would be a bible thumping movie i expected it to truly be a movie about ufos and alien abduction for entertainment s sake as previous reviewer comments it would be fine to show at a church but not at a public theater at least not without the consumer s prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about i felt deceived out of my spent for this movie as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones if you go to church it ll probably be shown there for free some time other than the cover up of its true subject matter the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained but preached to 
this movie was poorly conceived poorly written and poorly acted all of the characters were two dimensional it was a real amateur attempt the movie was fundamentalist christian propaganda the christian characters are holier than thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters the movie was a real gotcha for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer putting us in a very uncomfortable situation i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie i remember another movie on a similar subject the rapture starring mimi rogers that was much better and professionally done i think i ll watch the rapture again if you attend unidentified and don t like it don t say i haven t warned you 
how awful is it let me count the ways it is a bait and switch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation then turns into a high pressure sales job for christianity c mon if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it it annoys non believers and pushes fence sitters in the opposite direction it s not even a good sales pitch if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them i d run like hell in the opposite direction they re scary the acting is terrible they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace the cinematography is home movie bad wait actually its not even that good script bad bad bad all dialogue no action like a tennis match they bounce back and forth between the talking head close ups direction what direction oh there must have been a director there somewhere i challenge you to figure out where believe it or not i have some positive comments about this movie the editing seemed professional but couldn t make a difference a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie the opening theme music was actually very good very scary and ufo ish too bad the movie wasn t about ufos if you can t tell already here s the bottom line i wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry if they had not disguised what this movie was really about i could say it was my fault 
this movie was terrible it is not something that people should have to pay to see it looks like some christian group made it to convert people i don t understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci fi film from the s but quickly changed about minutes into the movie the characters start talking about god and do you believe in jesus it quickly moves into pure religion territory i thought i was going to a sci fi movie the film has poor acting bad camera angles and is amateurish avoid it 
calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn t want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won t get left behind at the rapture there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i don t believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula aside from the spiritual religious element the script was tedious saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a sunday school formula the movie wasn t all bad just most of it i am in favor of more clean movies that are well done and that present truth in a non preachy way this wasn t one of those i am sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to support that kind of movie now i d like my money back 
unfortunately i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango since i am a sci fi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested me instead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick appropriate for an audience of like minded individuals but very un christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions shame on you at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wild eyed craziness so this b grade movie and i am being kind production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups but if you are a mainline christian or non christian you will not be comfortable 
one of the worst films i have ever seen after watching it i walk out like what happened i am confused to this day can someone explain that movie to me please both the acting and picture quality are so bad you ll think you re watching someone s school project made with a home camcorder first i can not believe that how some people could give star to this movie because it s unbelievably bad movie this movie isn t scary at all there is even no typical horror clich s too the plot and acting of this movie was terrible it s not fantastic surrealistic or horror it s just hideously bad turkish feature film and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters when i watch gomeda i fell into so hopeless so sad for young turkish movie maker please please don t make cinema like this 
this movie is really bad there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings chilean landscape i know i must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie but the thing is that it is such a bad movie that i can only say that is actually bad michael ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film 
i gave this a out of a possible stars unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress in this film it s carly pope behaving like a ditz don t bother carly pope plays sara novak a young college student who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city a dangerous thing for even a well armed man to go in alone there are various intrigues in the film a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking sara a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole in the wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto a nerdish dim wit that hangs around the cynic s shop and a woman named emily gray who is back in prison sara s father is a lawyer who is handling emily gray s case a few years back emily gray attempted to drown a year old boy emily was put in a mental hospital for years and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged the only explanation emily has ever given for her crime is i never sinned it s all part of the design well my friend don t expect to ever get any better explanation than that because you won t 
i watched gomeda on movie theater at my city my friend took away me and i was really curious what would be it looked like well i must say this movie was not a horror may be we can say that is fantsastic experimentation ok here i go anyway but there was a lot of shooting acting dramatic theatrical and storytelling problems i can understand because of director is very young and gomeda is his first feature film ok directing of this film was not pretty bad i see unfortunately due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget the visuals are often as murky as the storyline and there is no powerful gothic scenes as a horror movie it really fails no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring some people say gomeda is an art movie but i could not see a laughable terrible and breoken off art movie like that so how can we say it is an art movie just funny 
this movie changed my life hogan s performance was nothing short of incredible and i still haven t recovered from his exclusion from the oscar nominations and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie you can t discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film if you haven t seen this movie drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy i guarantee it will blow your mind and if you don t like it then i just have one question for you watcha gonna do when the inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you 
 in search of the cheesiest so bad it s good movie i ve repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of various films only to be left disappointed and bored at the end not this time my eyes teared up my belly and my cheeks ached from laughing so hard throughout the movie sure hulk hogan is a subpar actor and the plot is utterly predictable but everyone dives into this movie knowing all this all anyone wants to see when renting this is hogan breaking out a can of whoopass with a bunch of yeah brother s and whatchugonnado s flying from his infamously goateed mouth and while the hulkster on the screen pales a bit in comparison to the hulkster in the ring seekers of the ultimate cheese will certainly not be disappointed by this backhand gem of a flick a laugh riot 
hulk hogan and zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i ll never know why if not for vince mcmahon s money this stupid film would have never been made maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling no holds barred is not that movie 
hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend joan severence is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler tiny lister jr bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it and with the evidence portrayed he should be 
a thinly veiled attempt to push hulkamania to the film going non wrestling fan what could be worse than hogan in the movies bad actors in the wrestling ring and this film produced both as tiny lester made his way to the wwe that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders see the dictionary under oops as a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when i came out i immediately checked into h a hulkamaniacs annoynimous i am proud to say i have been off the hulk for years now and have never had a craving since since this was made to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the wwe in hogans hey day one has to wonder if there weren t more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did such as huffing gas or russian roulette 
no holds barred is that movie that when you were nine or ten was the coolest movie this side of arnold schwarzenegger but then when you grow up and watch it you feel embarrassed that you were so gullible to have liked it you feel cheated embarrassed and stupid if you have a little brother and you show him this and he tells you it s gay give him a high five and take him to the strip bar for his eleventh birthday 
i remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out they showed clips every week on wwf tv and everyone was excited it debuted opening weekend at number two behind indiana jones and the last crusade then it did a nosedive critics hated this film i don t remember seeing one good review everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque i didn t know they meant back then but now i do since the movie makes references to gay bars women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol when i was younger i didnt care for that it was hulkamania brother now i find this pretty bad but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with bodyslam which has a better storyline first off hulk hogan s acting skills just aren t great he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring and actually rip and hulk are not to far off from each other kurt fuller is a good actor but he is not good at playing the bad guy he is better at comedy and nervous drama characters he is just not believable as brell there isn t much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of randy rip s brother and charlie the trainer in wrestling its unheard of a trainer escourting a wrestler to the ring lol tiny lister plays zeus the way its supposed to be played so there isnt any problem there joan severence is passable and for all you softcore hounds she does have a lingerie scene lol by the end you figure what s the point for this one as with other wrestling films or films that feature wrestlers as the main star turn your brain off you ll enjoy it more if you do 
i worked on this atrocity ten years ago luckily for me no one knows it because i didn t make the final cut and when i saw the movie in the theaters i was glad my agents were driven nuts by the apparently first time filmmakers rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often they later told me that once back in california we shot in atlanta these professionals had hours worth of footage even edited down to minutes it s at least twice as long as it needs to be i found hulk hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise what a waste of film 
no holds barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously it sucks hardcore as a serious movie look at it more in the way that you should plan from outer space they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny the funny moments in no holds barred are usually the ones that aren t supposed to be when rip played by hulk hogan as only he can play them grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with brell kurt fuller hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see it might be the funniest scene ever i swear anyway how someone thought this movie would make money i ll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission i hope they at least got fired this movie earns a out of on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts 
he s the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this crap deserves he s very handsome and very talented he deserves better than this also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this he s another talented actor who deserves better but like esai he gives a very good performance so if you re fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away one more complaint couldn t we have had more scenes of esai shirtless 
ignoring rocky this is easily hulk hogan s best film and it still rates as one of the worst films ever hulk hogan essentially plays hulk hogan bringing his wrestling buddies in for a film with all the cliches to go along with it the crooked promoter the unstoppable monster the injured kid the sexy woman and dookie 
in here in nz wrestling was somewhat of a mega hype phenom and who was steering starship at the pinnacle was the orange goblin himself hulk hogan one of my uber heroes at this time so it seems obvious to me now why i adored this movie in when it came out here hulk hogan a k a terry bollea is a shockingly bad actor and zeus a k a tiny lister is worse the story line follows a standard wwe then wwf circa story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength gained from eating vitamins saying prayers etc etc to mount the epic come back pretty standard formula here worth watching if only for reminiscing your youth 
being a wrestling fan movies about wrestling generally suck backyard dogs bodyslam jesse ventura story but this one isn t the worst i ve ever seen yes its bad but its better than some of the others i ve mentioned hulk hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn t want to be on that network let me explain it so everyone can understand picture usa network having rip and tnt will go to any lengths to get him does this make sense no well don t feel bad because it doesn t make sense nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a real fight with rip at the end of the movie none of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later hogan films its not so bad out of 
hulk hogan stars as a champion wrestler a real acting stretch named rip who is forced to defend his honor his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network because wrestling sells however when rip declines the network gets a circuit fighting championship called and i m totally serious battle of the tough guys who s champion zeus played by tiny lister jr maybe the deadliest man alive rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital no holds barred is pretty much what i expected from vince mcmahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre hogan it is basically lots of unintentional humor tons of awkward sequences a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity in other words it s not unlike wrestling itself so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they re getting the movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this i myself found this to be ultimately hilarious they re are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself such as the way hogan jumps feet in the air after being stuck in a limo how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way hogan recites from his cuecard i e i m not going to be around when this check clears no holds barred is a lot of fun true though it s mainly because of how ridiculous it is fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker out of fair 
a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable the giant zeus network president brell does everything in his power to draw wwf champion rip into the squared circle to face off against zeus for the championship of the battle of the tough guys but zeus is unlike any competitor rip has ever faced normally i would give hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role however this film didn t ask the hulkster to make very much of a stretch it simply asked hogan to play himself which he failed at miserably tiny lister made a good effort as the mighty zeus but even his work left the film lacking something namely acting watch this movie if you so desire with a grain of salt and a sense of humor otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in 
mind you it s not supposed to be but it is as a wee tot i watched this movie in the theatre being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didn t really like it very much i blacked the rest out and for good reason a poor film on par with the greats like gymkata and the pumaman no holds barred is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling well maybe the stakes aren t all that high and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything and really except for the first scene there s no wrestling to speak of so i guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating the c out of people sounds good right hulk hogan plays rip the champion of the wwf never let it be said that hulk hogan was typecast this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents essentially he s playing himself but with a wardrobe that s more black and blue than the hulkster s red and yellow he also has this hand gesture he does it s kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts except you stick your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger in my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an r try and see for yourself if that looks like an r well then mars needs women but anyway kurt fuller with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz plays a tv exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting rip who s evidentally bigger than elvis on his network he won t have any of it and exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled battle of the tough guys marketing genius this guy from the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but undies this movie has everything you d ever want in a dumb movie it s frivolous not too taxing on the mind violent and includes the phrase what s that smell dookie dookie a classic for all time 
i really should give this stinker more credit that star because the film has so many eye rolling lines that it s almost worth the price of the rental the acting if you want to call it that is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed wood s actors appear life like sammy the lone black character must be mimi s husband in real life because he appears in her other films but he has zero acting ability his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character his old man make up in her other turkey pushed to the limit is no budget junior high school quality with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair i cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand it really is beyond fear it s actually beyond funny 
alert this review contains major spoilers do not read on if you plan to see this film judging from the amount of votes this got my vote was the fifth one very few people know or care who mimi lesseos is well back in the late s professional wrestling was pretty decent an all woman s federation called the ladies professional wrestling association opened it was a great league and mimi lesseos was one of the names on the roster i always thought she was one of the best people the lpwa had in terms of ring skill and acting ability unfortunately the lpwa closed down in the early s so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as mimi to start an acting career right but surely there was an alternative to stuff like this this movie is really bad as it was going along i kept comparing it to an underrated movie called `survivor quest only this film lacks everything that made `survivor quest enjoyable as i started the tape i went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape at first i wasn t paying much attention but then i realized that the preview was for a movie starring mimi lesseos `oh i thought `here s another movie featuring mimi to look for but as the preview dragged on i became aware that is was a preview for beyond fear you know you re in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch the plot of this thing is pretty standard lesseos plays an ex kickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponent friend so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend sammy being a wilderness guide on this particular occasion she gets a troop of three couples two of the couples are just there to take up space you think that one couple a caucasian husband and a korean wife will be explored as an issue appears between them halfway through the film but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods which consistently scares the korean wife the joke is funny the first time you hear it but it certainly isn t by the ninth time they do it the third couple is just painful to watch it consists of mr and mrs page they trade insults back and forth and mr page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he s not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wife just like your typical american couple before the hike mr page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute one of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out mr page taped it so begins the peril as the two guys track the group on their trip and we wait and wait and wait and wait for them to finally do something when they do it s a fiasco you can t blame the cast they try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with the main culprit is director robert f lyons who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director s chair lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot there s even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes then there is the sound department the music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your television s speaker don t bump your head on the screen it isn t worth it to hear the poorly written lines speaking of poor writing lesseos gets some of the credit there as co writer the few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes early on lesseos knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs when the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by lesseos in a well done and long fight our cast all have a huge laugh together despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere yes everyone is happy in the end everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film wishing for the good old glory days when mimi performed in the wrestling ring zantara s score out of 
this formulaic film hero s girlfriend marries the villain just didn t move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story scott seems too old in this one and too many times his character turns away from decisive action deflating the scenes he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly he escapes from knox s gang by hiding in a full rain barrel his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous as does much of the film the plot could have been tightened high points of the film seeing tennessee ernie ford without a mustache singing man in the saddle alfonso bedoya s too brief scenes as a cook the color photography of the high country and the fight scene there with john russell 
by randolph scott standards of the s this is a disappointing and heavy handed star western two or three of the characters could be dispensed with while two or three other characters could be given more prominence the humour needs to be completely rewritten de toth handles the action well as always but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak 
southern cross written and directed by james becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor s efforts a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it s promise which this film does not it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains unexplainedly follow them this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said oh great lets do a shoot out scene there don t even waste your rental money on this it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama 
over the gw is a near failure of a debut feature and not because it s not without trying actually it is it s a shamble all the more because it s writer director technical everyman nick gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film sometimes a first time filmmaker full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed unsure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story the extremely personal side gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story gaglia who was when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their patients with crazy group scare tactics psychological mind f sessions that could go on for days and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe escaped finally when he was i m glad he got out though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film making skills if only for a couple of days to learn things like say structure proper lighting fluid camera movement subtlety with actors and other basics that are perpetually lost here it s all the more frustrating because gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cult rehab many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas this is an ever nagging sensation throughout over the gw where it almost feels like gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn t know how to communicate it properly through his characters the character that one would think is closest to him bronx teen tony serra gallagher who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey would be closest to gaglia is actually much more of a one dimensional being where there is very little back story we see a brief freak out in black and white in his old home and little connection to his mother moriarty who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another but there is a story to go with his two year crisis i guess right off the bat things get rough a nude cavity search in the first five minutes and soon it s clear that instead of medical care it s more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect where the head doctor hiller insinnia is a total over controlling loon but soon tony s sister sofia donohue gets thrown in to the program and as opposed to tony s repeated moments of outrage and supposed non compliance she goes head on through the whacked out three step program and once released becoming a runaway at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare where there s one woman a year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she s become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them that do contain some raw power very brief glimpses of gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama but these are moments few and far between it s not just the unsuccessful characters who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical d a r e rip offs maybe some of them like an angry black youth the passive aggressive counselors or even serra s older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them it s that gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through he over uses tints mostly with a shade that looks urine coated he jiggles his hand held dvx camera as if it s supposed to be intense ala city of god occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo indie soft rockers and there s even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra inspiration and krakowsky that feel about as false as possible could gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would be artistically cathartic plan b bottom line no matter how much from the heart true life stories may appeal to you don t bother seeing it in the theater or even on rental unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital hued hudson river sunset with the final words reading dedicated to the kids oy 
i found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest but the other odd shorts really didn t pique my interest or make me think of anything at all the music and mm footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random i would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free as for the music being so in step that didn t come across either i rented the dvd because i thought it was all stop motion animation or sma mixed with live action and only the first short was sma the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action there was paper cut out stuff in one and the rest was outdoor shots from an mm camera with the music bed just didn t have any meaning to it i could see 
now i m a big animation fan love svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so i had high hopes for this one then i came on imdb and paused i m always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on imdb here we ve got another a bunch of s shill anyone and then some real low ones i m also suspicious of s with the word visionary in them sure there are visionaries but this character isn t one of them despite my misgivings i saw this film and have to side with the ones the stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish treat yourself to the real deal get some svankmeyer and leave this also ran on the shelf 
walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume kids with too much time on their hands in small town elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids don t know a thing though and gracious for us we get to see steve guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia d abo should have called this one off too the big green can be known as the big bomb 
this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me everything i hate about films is present fake sentimentality extreme corniness bad child actors and more feature abundantly that s ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of american sports fans with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon what that s a rugby ball the story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like who coincidently teaches the class in a short skirt and gets them interested in football naturally they re all rubbish don t forget they re no hopers except for one kid who has moved from el paso blah blah etc etc and the kids still don t become good footballers but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well rounded kids hell even the adults start to come round drunks are turned into caring parents illegal immigrants are let off the hook groan this movie stars steve guttenberg now before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy hold up a minute guttenberg is rubbish no no come on let s face it how did this guy ever get to be in a movie i have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea olivia d abo stars along side steve and doesn t impress either she merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it although i have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this most of them are disgusting and or annoying and it doesn t make for pleasant viewing at all there s a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job but you wouldn t see a movie for a goat so don t bother seeing this movie 
take a clich story and insert steve guttenberg need i say anymore this truly is as bad as you would expect sheriff tom palmer guttenberg and anna montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless inept kids into a winning soccer team lacking originality and direction from the offset it s quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film despite my reservations about guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than guttenbergs previously unimaginable i thought this type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called film 
nothing more than a soccer knock off of the mighty ducks this film proved to be annoying in most aspects this was one of those times where you re parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don t have to deal with them for a few hours to say the least my younger sisters liked it but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks oh well at least olivia d abo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time 
this is one of the most unoriginal cliche ridden movies i have ever seen even if you didn t like this film s antecedents the bad news bears and the mighty ducks they are bound to have done a better job than this one from the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her don t bother with us we re all losers you can see everything that s coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film all the usual suspects are here besides the spunky teacher we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids they re brats yes but no so endearing a slow witted small town sheriff that they love to torment an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team etc ad nauseum only olivia d abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty i never cared much for steve guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn t change things jay o sanders is a capable actor but his character the rival coach leaves him nothing to work with let s hope that writer director holly goldberg sloan comes up with something better next time out 
how many movies are there going to be in which against all odds a ragtag team beats the big guys with all the money there s nothing new in the big green if anything you want them to lose steve guttenberg used to have such a good resume the boys from brazil police academy cocoon why oh why did he have to do these sorts of movies during the s and beyond so just avoid this movie there are plenty of good movies out there so there s no reason to waste your time and money on this junk obviously the green on their minds was money because there s no creativity here at least in recent years disney has produced some clever movies with pixar 
also titled the magical castle this one is a stretch why bother why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake only some girlfriend of rockbart the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters not voices remain stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread next thing you know some bird will have memorized the forbidden arts and swan princess the magical bird will be born thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close 
formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like a tv movie not really exciting the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell s part is very small and doesn t add much to the movie michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare 
i loved the first movie the second one was okay disappointed john cleese wasn t jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character but the third one what happened to the animation it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie they really should have stopped after number this just makes the rest look bad derek s voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob rogers also looks very strange i also don t understand where rothbart came from i thought he died this movie made me want to turn it off as much as i love the first one i was very disappointed with this installment they will never beat the original 
i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new year s and she picked out the swan princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid and we just watched both films while she s sleeping i figured i could get a couple comments in while this is a very cheesy cartoon it really wasn t that bad you have to admit that for children these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them odette finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of rosthoe and she tells derek to destroy them immediately but him being a guy typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help when a witch named zelda gets her hands on them she finds out that derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything and she kidnaps odette in order to retrieve this information the swan princess the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable but for the kids i would honestly say it s a go it s so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days so i m going to cut the film some slack it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden i grew up with the first one so i guess it was just stuck in my head 
i am the sort of person who never ever watches animated movies but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind determined to love it because i d spent money buying it i finished the movie and all i can think is the horror i wanted to like it i really did i tried very very hard to like it but i couldn t enjoy a second of this grueling film the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film i am going to try repress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i d never set eyes on the third do yourself and favor and don t waste your time 
i think my summary says it all this mtv ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x or is that gen y type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations example kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his wedding kennedy is the bride done up in a full bridal gown and long wig the joke is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his bits and pieces problem is this schtick goes on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one running around constantly asking do i look fat i recognize the show was not made for me it was made for year old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show was short lived 
wow was this version of the racketeer tough to watch while none of the other reviews have mentioned this the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed the sound track was off by about seconds meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching so you d hear something occur well before you saw it a very confusing proposition the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi while this seriously marred the film it also made concentrating on the dialog easier and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well the dialog was simply awful often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling as one review said it was like watching a high school play part of this is understandable as sound was a new medium but this film s dialog was bad even compared to other films really bad and like many of these early sound films the film was just too talky with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action and you d think with a title like the racketeer that there would be some action however it s really a sappy romance with very little action the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him and the crook robert armstrong comes to her assistance when armstrong catches her cheating at cards he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet and naturally he falls for her in the process the problem is that once the drunk sobers up he too wants lombard and she needs to choose between them wow a recovering drunk or a mobster talk about a couple great prospects overall it s a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw however even if you ignore this the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature and it was sappy too boot 
carole lombard stars in this transition period film this film is a typical example of a very early talkie first practical sound film was the jazz singer overall the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic the viewer may easily note that the actors are still acting for a silent film and this combined with the overly pronounced overly earnest dialog it seems most likely a diction elocution drama coach was employed extensively to teach the silent actors to speak lines creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical carole lombard s later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures melodrama and eager earnestness mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period and for it s completely unintended comedy camp value 
time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves there are of course complications the problem with the film for me is that it hasn t aged well performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery there are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment normally i m forgiving but this time out i just couldn t go with the flow then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible worth a shot in a forgiving mood and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong 
 the racketeer stars carol deprived of the e that usually appeared at the end of her first name lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist roland drew who has since become a down and out alcoholic and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong top billed it s virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies stiff direction immobile cameras stagy acting and ridiculously slow paced delivery of lines at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s l o w l y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs done about five years later this could have been an interesting movie but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder s dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies the racketeer was made in a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces vidor s hallelujah mamoulian s applause wyler s hell s heroes capra s ladies of leisure all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically too bad howard higgin wasn t that strong as it is watching a naturally rapid paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he s been told to speak one can t help but wonder where that foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him 
sammi cheng andy lau are coupled yet again in their rd film yesterday once more directed by hk s actioneer johnnie to fans of to s action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming furthermore fans of cheng lau s previous films needing you love on a diet will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing mr mrs to lau cheng are a divorced couple both affluent hk citizens both incredibly mischievous both just happened to be professional thieves two birds of the same feather a couple years earlier they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot now she s remarrying to the son of a rich heiress a total momma s boy carl ng through through the soon to be mother in law jenny woo is suspicious of mrs to s past thinks she s only marrying her son for the family jewels the heiress priceless ruby necklace the necklace is stolen is it mrs to s materialistic eye that gets the best of her or is it her ex husband mr to s way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself this is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love its about two pple who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it they let pride greed overwhelm them overall yesterday is one part caper heist film one part homage to classic hollywood glamour from its golden years i e cary grant grace kelly s to catch a thief johnnie to is riding too heavily on cheng lau s chemistry from their previous films hoping cheng lau s immense popularity fan base will be enough justification for this third film i think sammi cheng is one of the most likable charming entertainers working t day lau is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema i really enjoyed their first two films consider the cheng lau pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the s s but yesterday falls very short of expectations terrible writing ridiculous situations product placements galore all the subplots supporting characters were unnecessary come to think of it this film was unnecessary unless you just love celebrity watching 
i ve seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst my family bought the dvd unsuspectingly and couldn t even make it through the first half i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing it had been a christmas gift to me and was just appalled the only redeeming factor and it s hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show is mark lin baker playing the mock turtle with a yiddish accent it s one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously other than that the songs are half songs the melodies are half melodies and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good 
terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can t save curiously detached occasionally clumsy quasi comedy from joel and ethan coen depression era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process the film meanders along but never builds any momentum it does get a big boost from clooney s charismatic gableesque mugging and also from the art direction and t bone burnett s lively music otherwise the screenplay by the coens is seriously lacking in humor and interest supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift and the second half of the movie slides precariously into self indulgence from 
how can anybody give this anything higher than a i thought manos the hands of fate would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve indeed i didn t think anything could be worse i was wrong galaxina is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly agonizingly blindingly bad how often have you watched a movie and commented who the hell lit this thing from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to well everything this movie is absolutely unendurable it s so bad i couldn t even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i d ever seen it s too bad even to be laughable i d sooner eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again 
if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci fi film around a sexy statuesque female android surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time well sadly this movie is pretty close to useless there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said however there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise firstly this is a comedy with no funny bits at all or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way secondly the title character is woefully underused this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film i don t think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest anyway what we are left with is a whole lot of mind numbing comedy relief which often is made up of hopeless spoof type gags of the big sci fi hits of the time such as alien star wars and it s badly written and not funny at all and it doesn t even really have a plot to propel things along the story basically is about a police space cruiser that is sent to get a rock that s it steven spielberg once said that a high concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence what he didn t define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence pointless maybe this seemed like a sure fire winner to me but it failed miserably it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn t close to what it should ve been a barbarella for the s this ain t shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it s cult interest i just think it s a great shame that dorothy didn t have a better film left to immortalise her 
the odd thing about galaxina is not that it is supremely bad although it is the odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad it is not funny supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor the secret of their success you might say but galaxina is quite uniquely different it is mst k s worst nightmare a bad movie in which the intentional and the unintentional humor alike fall flat it is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail and the reasons are quite varied sometimes it s a timing question sometimes it s a good idea badly worked out the human restaurant could have been hilarious but it wasn t sometimes it feels like there was some mixup in the cutting room with the punchline ending up on the floor and sometimes the jokes are just bad jokes bad movies get their laughs from such unintentional snafus it s harder to figure out why galaxina doesn t get any laughs on that count something is subtly wrong with the unintentional humor in this movie just as something is wrong not at all subtly with the intentional humor it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is it s absolutely unique in my experience 
this is not the worst movie i ve ever seen i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina it just is not good the jokes are almost funny but fall short all of them the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over the production values are well non existent the sound is bad the lighting is bad it just seems cheaply made overly so the dialog well often it is missing many awkward silences they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy like maybe that developed after shooting started it feels like someone s film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been good and i m easy to please i thought mom and dad save the world was a hoot i like pluto nash mystery men is one of my favorite movies spaced invaders is well nigh unto a classic this turkey just doesn t do it space truckers was more believable avery schreiber who can be very funny tries too hard his part calls for a straightman and he plays it leaning toward sitcom dorothy stratten is ok in her role but not particularly noteworthy oh yeah the my watch is always slow line was funny i ll give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs it the space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively the space scenes are vague no sweeping passes no close up detailed fly bys not even appropriate action scenes when they dock the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point the flight dynamics are terrible worse than anything you ve seen they re jerky not smooth the initial battle is stilted and static even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion they trade slow shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a th century sea battle except not as exciting the aliens imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time but not the fifth mercifully if you attempt to watch galaxina you are likely to fall asleep i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth replaying it if that doesn t say it sucked i don t know what does sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie it would be easy to remake this and have a decent film madkaugh
i m not a movie snob i ve liked lots of movies that critics hate and i ve hated movies that critics love however i have to agree with critics here galaxina is just substandard clearly intended to be a comedy it only has a few scattered laughs galaxina has poor photography it has poor special effects it has some pretty poor acting and the production values well the sets might as well have been made of cardboard galaxina tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called the blue star after a long voyage and some very unconvincing space battles the crew arrives at its destination a sort of wild west alien world there s a painfully unfunny cantina scene clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous star wars scene a chase involving space bikers and a final getaway the cast tries but can t breathe life into this turkey stephen macht and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship s crew the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title and while she looks great her role doesn t give her much of a chance to act you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten however if you re looking for a good movie you ll probably want to skip this one 
i ve seen worse films this is bad but at least doesn t try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause it rest firmly in the realms of the low budget b movie sci fi genre it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it s in the bargain bin at your local supermarket awfully charming rather than just plain awful the highlight for me is when galaxina s lover goes to rescue her upon turning up she exclaims bunnyfluff which draws sniggers from his co pilot sit back get drunk enjoy 
i have yet to watch starcrash that notoriously cheesy italian take on star wars but it can t be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which suffice it to say makes mel brooks so so spaceballs look like a veritable work of art in fact the main reason why galaxina is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady playboy centerfold dorothy stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband before the film had even had its official premiere although statten who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by jamie lee curtis and mariel hemingway plays the title role for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a year journey to some planet or other in fact galaxina is an all purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the blue star cue choral music once they land having said that statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess it s not exactly demeaning either still it s ironic that for a film which bears her name she is overshadowed by the campy and would be zany antics of her fellow crew members especially the annoying captain cornelius butt which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here a long eared wing sporting colored guy a pot smoking proverb quoting old chinaman and best of all relatively speaking a foul mouthed rock eating hairy alien creature they hold prisoner the villain of the piece is a metal clad non entity who does however have the best laugh in the film when upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the blue star exclaims what is this s t there is little point in listing the sci fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious incredibly enough a chest busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive hollywood veteran angelo rossitto for what it s worth then the scenes shot on the planet they visit which looks more like a western set than a planetary landscape have a yellowish sun like hue and its inhabitants are human gourmets delicacies on their menu include skin and tonic scotsman on the rocks thigh pies baked alaskan etc not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity the harley davidson and when our heroes escape on the back of it they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their lord god awful indeed 
this picture hit the movie screens on june th starring stephen macht as sergeant thor avery schreiber as captain comelius butt j d hinton as buzz and starring playmate of the year dorothy stratton the picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for i guess criminals there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship enters sergeant thor and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to when failing they call on captain comelius who instructs his crew to fight back enters the gorgeous dorothy stratton who plays the role of galaxina who is man made robot an now a few thoughts on this picture this movie was plan stupid and it s one of the reasons that i don t get into sci fi if you re into sci fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci fi movie that aired back in titled star trek now for the reason that i bought this movie dorothy stratton she is gorgeous in her one piece suit i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage connie sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also on the picture alone i give this movie weasel star and on dorothy stratton i give her weasel stars even though she didn t deserve to be put into a trash movie like this if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon com
for connoisseurs of bad movies galaxina is a true gem with truly horrid dialog acting and directing it s no choice for people seeking a proper movie but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre it s priceless for a good laugh in particular the scenes involving the harley davidson worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh sadly the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver but since she s playing an android i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting bad movie lovers don t pass this one up 
 what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog cheap sets and bad acting you would have galaxina this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek unfortunately it also led to some bad movies and this was obviously one of them i say obviously because i hadn t even heard of this film until a few days ago i missed it when it came out in here s the underlying problem dorothy stratton couldn t act so for most of the movie they didn t even let her try i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status but for the life of me i can t understand why clearly the movie tried to spoof star wars star trek and aliens but they clearly don t understand than when you spoof something it has to be funny this movie wasn t or at least the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren t science fiction is ripe for parody as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved this movie however did it poorly 
earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a s nostalgia period piece the adventurers this time are escaped convicts wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film besides its value to the tone of the movie the music is just plain fun to listen to what cripples the film is that the characters really aren t that likable in a comedy you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures instead we have a bunch of selfish arrogant soulless mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all they re not imposing enough to make you hate them either so it s hard to relate to them at all they re offered up as clowns but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades they just aren t funny like the story that inspired it the movie takes these guys on an odyssey encountering a variety of symbolic some even mystical characters everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes the operative word being stupid people are mocked right and left and consequently no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing the movie doesn t like its own characters and it doesn t let you like them either riverside baptisms beautiful sirens stolen cars fistfights radio preachers people being whipped with sticks all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion some evoke a few laughs others confuse or bore you i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes an example some s dillinger type guy strafes cows with a tommy gun comedy symbolism no just mindless violence which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon other adaptations of the odyssey are much better unless you re a george clooney fan rent something else but buy the soundtrack cd the music is great 
dorothy stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci fi spoof and her appearance is a disappointment though she has the title role her screentime is limited and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue if you re not a stratten fan pass this one up 
yesterday i watched this tv production and i was very disappointed i didn t have big expectations when it was a tv production but the complete movie was pain with no ending i felt it lasted for hours but it was just me who was bored to death every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the turn off switch the movie is about a doctor dr verghese who gets a lot of aids patients and most of them die during the movie it is hard for verghese to live with so his family gets punished with his frustrations however this movie has problems showing both sides it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients and sometimes we see flicks from his home but we don t get much the difficulties to show more than one part of verghese s life doesn t get any better with the poor acting from naveen andrews a man i hopefully can t see in any good future movies i believe it got because of the subject taboo but i m sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market stay away from this movie it does not deserve more than 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this there s a bunch of apes wandering about mumbling b acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period i can t believe there s even a sequel to this 
i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had tails it s a stinker of epic proportions what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had the comedy is extremely weak i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny you might find a laugh or two the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art and there s just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together it seems to drag on and on and on well you may be asking yourself if it s as bad as you say why haven t you rated it lower than a good question and i ve got two answers first the movie is not without its curiosity value i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years b c with raquel welch i ll give when women had tails a point for its historic value the other two points are for the mere presence of senta berger i know it s not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do it s the best i can come up with 
way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails these cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo a camel a monkey but no women this film tells of the hilarious misadventures of seven or so cavemen having burned their land with the new discovery of fire moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage along the way we get such great moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach a monkey throwing rocks at their heads a man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach the obligatory gay caveman the list could go on and on this movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck i was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen bobbled around hitting each other making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch hitting each other and mauling poor seta berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense she is indeed one of two bright spots in this film she isn t much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass et the other bright spot is the music as soon as i heard the score i said to myself that it sounded very familiar i had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of ennio morricone it s a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude boring lewd unimaginative and ridiculous film essentially about a group of moes finding a woman for the first time and first wanting to eat her like some animal being taught what she could do awwwwh sorry i m stifling a yawn as i relive the plot the end of the film has some or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a scab off your knee this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever the fact that it spawned a sequel doesn t surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest tail 
i don t really know why so many persons love this movie maybe it s funny ok but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written as the author himself said this movie has betrayed the book not only the story is violently cut to about but all the symbols all the complexity everything is lost in a very s fashioned fantasy adventure film for kids today we have effects directors a new attention to books i hope that someone tim burton peter jackson hayao miyazaki someday will direct the real neverending story a great dead writer a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it 
i saw this film before two weeks it s kitsch boring and totally unintelligible for people that haven t read the original book there are many fact mistakes too actors plays rather poor you must laugh even in the sad moments it was a totally waste of time 
the girls might be prettier if you re their accompanist or a faced onlooker what i m sayin is that it ll take special circumstances for a non whince reaction to this effort the delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors lighting seems to be a problem too although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting and if you view this film be open minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject they are the above and below ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty louisiana mansion that s the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths then two of them disappear and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt eureka i just realized what one of those aforementioned special circumstances would be unconsciousness 
this is probably the worst film i have ever seen it makes plan from outer space look wonderful the acting is wooden the plot silly and the sfx non existent the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film the scenery is sometimes quite pretty assuming you like trees if that helps any 
i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h p lovecraft s the lurking fear that was shot in louisiana outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first minutes but then tries to inject its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better adaptation than full moon s the lurking fear too bad it is a terrible film director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short i swear i counted maybe two camera movements the creature design is cheap we re talking store bought masks here but shot in a dark manner intentional or not where they are somewhat creepy the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well file this one under good adaptation poor execution 
although not a big coen brothers fan i am an admirer of their dark humor films like fargo and miller s crossing i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode goofy camp or is that camp goofy unfortunately o brother where art thou falls into the latter category and isn t even as good as the big lebowski or the hudsucker proxy o brother is basically an episodic series of in jokes without much point and not all that much humor or cleverness either as most reviewers have noted the film s plot is very loosely and as far as i could tell quite arbitrarily based on the odyssey its main character ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is an adventurer like his homeric namesake and has as his real goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor of course we don t discover that this is what the clooney ulysses character really wants until long after we ve stopped caring and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs ku klux klan meetings a la indiana jones cult gatherings a disbarred lawyer s vocabulary a talent for blue grass country music singing an association with baby face nelson a clark gable lookalike hairdo and other random and sundry character traits and encounters i leave that for others to discern the allusion to preston sturges sullivan s travels in o brother s title is equally pointless yes viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot scene riffs e g hopping freight cars and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie but so what the coen brothers don t seem to have anything to add to the art for art s sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art they obviously fall into the former school but that doesn t seem to motivate the reference in the slightest is it an homage if so why make it i like post modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person but it s a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally if not thematically consistent and not just an arbitrary concoction this screenplay is simply a silly mess the only consistent and consistently pleasing element is the folk country music soundtrack it doesn t have much to do with homer or preston sturges but considering the rest of the film that s probably a good thing on the other hand i d recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd 
before i really slag this film off i just want to say i absolutely loved it firstly how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase you re right i m sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again secondly what the hell is with those blue monkey things ok so the dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie creatures and finally old faithful here will protect me hahaha 
everything about this movie was bad the acting was bad and the plot was bad and were is all the blood and gore that was in demons which is a good movie and it was not scary at all my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad the only plus in this movie was the music by the smiths and the cult but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film i haven t seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time 
saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun spooky spirit of it s predecessor this is unfortunately not the case the set up is similar as the first in which a horde of flesh eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played the first had been a movie theater this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv once the demons are released madness and mass carnage ensues that s pretty much it as far as plot development goes it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make up fx fast pace and unpredictability the sequel however doesn t cut it the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don t really care about one way or another if they were annoying or idiots then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered demonized eaten alive but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered plus the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building and out of it they are constantly cutting back and forth between them which kept pulling me out of the story there are some amusing bits courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor s construction after another as if it were alien acid the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child however that sequence parlays into a ridiculous looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene but i don t think that was bava s intention the scene probably would ve worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman but hey other little things like the over zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don t help matters in summation i managed to see the unrated version on dvd and can t imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version because the make up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it also notable is an early role of producer argento s future hottie daughter asia in fact she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she s barely on screen argento bava fan s might want to check it out just to see it but will probably find themselves looking at their watch like i did gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy looking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from dead alive you could do worse but it certainly doesn t live up to the original 
the films use of blue black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set pieces were quite stunning black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine naked lunch directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs esque otherwise give this film a wide girth bava and argento fans once again are bitterly disappointed 
this film sucks it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random good gore but little plot sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon i figured that she had pms it sure seemed that way the dubbing in this film is horrible one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio i knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the us i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film some good characters but not many not worth wasting one s time 
 spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldn t have figured out yourselves yeah it s really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know they re basically the same thing the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasn t really necessary he d let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so they d run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn t want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv s in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day 
please why on earth did bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap to begin with we the viewers at home are treated to a narration from some unknown ding bat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankind s triumph over the demons yeah right i can tell you right now that this doesn t in anyway what so ever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether bava as usual makes a casual appearance that doesn t even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set oh god i m not going to go on go see for yourself as usual you ll be treated to laughable dubbing crap scenarios that don t make any sense and above all un answered questions how typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crap overall if you re one of those dvd argentophile collector s then maybe you ll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague it s no way near the first so you may wanna avoid like the plague 
when the word presents finds its way into a title preceded by a famous name the work is usually immediately dismissible for some reason people who are capable of creating good art don t seem to be able to see it in others however i ve always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try for one thing the soundtracks are absolutely to die for most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons for another well two words asia argento of course she was eleven when this film was made and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren steamy looks and little clothing as well lamberto bava comes from one of italy s finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo he s the son of mario bava who may well have invented the genre in the sixties and the original demons is an absolute must see for fans of eighties b horror films so how bad can this be right well bad the demons continue their assault on italian media as the movie opens in a modern italian high rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background they re all watching a kind of combination news report mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film through the usual horror film extra inability to concentrate the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anew yeah it s that bad about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack when you re not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths the cult gene loves jezebel etc is stunning it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackers makes a half decent free rental if you re planning on drinking heavily but it s certainly nowhere near the fun the original was cronenberg s wonderfully funny high rise nasty creature romp shivers aka they came from within is a whole lot better 
everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here this is simply a run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc slasher but without the passion that graced the original there s nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether here the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in grisly fashion the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around although the actors weren t exactly brilliant in demons in demons they re actually a lot worse you don t care about these characters at all the plot is nonexistent the music poor apart from one simon boswell song it s not scary in the least it s just not that good easily the worst film dario argento has been involved with and lamberto bava s also bava has a cameo in this film not a very funny one maybe is too high a rating but at least i could watch it all and didn t think of stopping midway my advice stick to the original 
typically elaborately crafted hbo production with a first rate cast a rich small town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes graced by above average production values but and that s a huge but the various subplots peopled with some likable mostly annoying caricatures are paper thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours the often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama without being entertaining enough and personal drama without being profound at all a shame because some scenes really shine two or three that is out of grubby paul newmans
although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from andy warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewer friendly in any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing joe buck naked almost all the time and the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half way this would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own 
despite the all star cast this attempt at epic fails it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too too clever social commentary it s as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says isn t that clever am i not smart isn t that biting social commentary and sadly the answer is always ummmm no wearying self absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera in the worst sense of the term than a movie and an obvious attempt at television immortality thankfully it died young empire falls falls flat 
wow what can i say i was born in i love bad tv movies love them i get involved the works i want to get involved i m spending time watching the thing i watched the emmys last night on tv how in the infinite world was the empire falls excellent name tv movie up for any awards it truly had wonderful talent of course and they tried admirably but how can anyone pretend that was an ok tv for goodness sakes screenplay ok direction you know i wish everyone the best really but i thought it was totally mind bending that hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many honors awards for me it was sort of a wake up call that hollywood is such a small insular community being cynical is not really my thing but wow xptyngi
put simply this mini series was terrible let me count the ways absurd plotting over acting scattershot approach to characters annoying narration inability to create viewer interest this film can t even pass the soap opera for dummies test i m sorry i have not read this award winning novel so i am judging it only as a film but it really stinks imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers you look at the wide variety and want to taste them but suddenly they are withdrawn and you wonder where they went that s like this film with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a episode series yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you ll find on monkeys the pace is extraordinarily slow dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over the top that their characters are not believable joanne woodward s character is one dimensional the persistent river metaphor becomes trite and probably the most absurd part of the film the cat this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers well come on now it s not even good stephen king probably the most interesting character in the film and one who is not drawn well is john voss the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film just about everyone in this film is unbelievable to sum up there s little here to inspire the drama is poor melodrama it s just a terrible effort 
i m relieved the later reviews have turned sour reading all the positive feedback i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies and life was completely different than everyone else s in the world everything in this movie rang false to me the characters the dialogue the manipulative soundtrack the corny narration all of it as each scene unfolded i kept thinking people don t act like this it s relentlessly heavy handed and maudlin in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it or pretending to like it because it s serious and about real people and confronts issues but man it really did not work for me 
we found this movie nearly impossible to watch with such a super cast it s a shame that the writing and direction were so awful the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening the flash backs were clumsy the characters were one dimensional the heavy handed metaphors the river the cat were repeated way too often the movie nobody s fool based on another novel by russo was infinitely better probably because it was more tightly written and directed the photography in empire falls was lovely too bad it wasn t a travelogue i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself i would give the novel out of stars perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel s reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie this was supposed to be a television movie guys not books on tape 
i know my summary sounds very harsh but this film has very limited appeal the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film the entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs this is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum however unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes i can respect the work that went into it but it s just not compelling 
not even emeril lagasse cooking can save this disjointed overheaded idiotic nonsense starring emeril lagasse as a tv chef from the food channel who with help of the crew to try to make the show better poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain robert urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever r i p this is the worst show of and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade i feel very sorry for emeril lagasse for making this sitcom he even said himself it stunk it s hard to believe that they are the same producers of designing women that did this mess tv review star
it s hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on i did not like the film it s crappy there are orgies they have taboo sex gay sex bi sex oral sex rape anal sex masturbation brother sister sex brother brother sex sex on drugs sex without drugs sex sex sex seems to rule their world i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid the story is just dirty and shameful i wonder what made those people get up with this story and above all who cares the technical stuff didn t satisfy me as well the sound is poor so is the editing and the direction is absent the actors are admittedly fine but guess what it s their job their job is to act no need to jump off your seats if an actor did a decent job do you applause when a bus driver brings you home safely see i gave it because after all this thing had something that i can t put in words b movie charm camp fun nudity i don t know 
i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say i was not impressed not at all i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances but some good performances do not make a good movie on the discussion board i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points it says deed poll is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes the brilliant acting of barbara kowa and andr schneider the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work steffen ritter make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips especially in sound however the boredom the audiences have to deal with for minutes remains unfortunately this is true i wasn t intrigued by the story at all the protagonists are cold ambition less people they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of incestuous sex so what for many times the direction seemed to be virtually non existent not to mention the technical aspect the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing what s the point of the movie what s the message behind it all the anonymous reviewer said somehow biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid air without a message thus the boredom i blame on the movie the movie is reserved and emotionless cold almost neutral and it doesn t take long to see the flaws for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation the character of the mute brother is not developed very well some moments are very promising though in the scene where the call boy is skinned the one and only true love scene an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away again i must agree i did like the final scene especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni meurer and andr schneider but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes the sex scenes though were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited all in all deed poll was not my cup of tea a good controversial idea wasted but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director this would have become a better movie 
 electra glide in blue is a slow moving b flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation a mediocre film at best eg in b features some members of the band chicago a whiff of action some philosophizing and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler not worth the time 
technically abominable with audible pops between scenes and awesomely amateurish flesh requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe dallesandro who exposes his body in almost every scene also gives an utterly convincing performance a curio to be sure but the more polished trash made two years later is a definite step forward i suggest you watch that instead 
i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time i ve always been intrigued by the title the star and the desert but for some now pretty clear reason this film is never shown on tv or i ve happen to miss it if it s ever shown well after watching the dvd i now know why the movie is rarely shown it s because it s not that good in fact i d say it s pretty much of a mess electra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together the movie can be boiled down to this intro murder cop and girlfriend together intro credits cops going to work crazy guy tells story cop finds dead body cop and chief and girlfriend at bar chase scene etc the scenes just don t flow together they re very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak borderline amateurish the scene at the bar with the girlfriend the scene at the farm with the hippies the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy i almost stopped the film during those awful moments the film maker s lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film the style like the s is all over the map the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement then it tries to be a buddy film big john and zipper then a murder mystery then a melodramatic love story etc a film doesn t have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i m afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it the film is not a complete disaster while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish the look of it is extremely and deceptively professional the cinematography is stunning every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery or because the first and last time director was involved in the music business worthy of an album cover the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves and thanks to robert blake s acting of a really badly written character the film maintains a certain level of realism even though nothing else makes much sense what s remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it s been copied and duplicated a million times over the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun which was made years later scenes of johnny dressing up with his clothes on the bed reminded me of american gigolo strangely enough electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it due to the stunning visuals even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated so electra glide in blue is on one hand a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit but on the other hand egib is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters confusing story and muddled direction none of which are worth of remembering 
first off i am a huge fan of robert blake always have been this movie came on movieplex last night and the title interested me of course the star but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started there are some good scenes and i thought they would lead somewhere but they didn t it turned out to be an anti cop anti buddy anti hippie pretty much anti everything movie with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere robert blake is great as the lead well as great as someone could be with this bad movie i am still a huge fan of mr blake and love his acting even in crap like this but this drug induced s tripe well better stay away from this one and that ending what a pisser 
the show is at least partially faked so is not reality just pretending to be reality which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episode proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there can been seen as his boat approaches the actors playing ambulance officers didn t remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it which would never happen in reality they also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the emergency entrance which does not make any sense unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there 
i think cheaters needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don t care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just spewing out propaganda and the host of cheaters joey greco is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and unawares no it just will show disgusting he is also the wiretapping and following of people by cheaters spy s is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the s s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you infowarrior
i m not bothered by the sleazy hosts nor am i bothered by the cynical self righteous stance the makers of this crap take what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake i wouldn t even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged hence this isn t a reality show but something far worse even than oprah garbage television with zero comma zero appeal like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot the premise would have turned out great if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer if only this idea were free of all the legal complications trappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people and what is eventually aired hence the only way to create this reality show was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time shouldn t this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school most reviews i read here don t even mention that any of this is fake let alone that all of it might be wishful thinking or just boundless naivety the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom of the barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show or this crap which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks i even recognized one actress in the role of cheater that i saw years earlier in the jerry springer show and i only saw episodes of cheaters how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and cheaters that i don t even know about however to compare cheaters with springer isn t fair to the latter the springer show is not all fake a bulk of the episodes are unstaged hence often highly entertaining there is no value to be found in cheaters unless you re a struggling actor and want to get tips on how not to act in front of the camera the producers use various very cheap transparent tricks to create the illusion of realness to give their footage that elusive documentary feel but it s all in vein in the end the more intelligent train wreck seeking viewer is left with absolutely squat professional wrestling has more credibility than this 
there is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men one sees it in television adverts and program plots cheaters is a prime example they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men why the prime threat to any government s power resides in the male population they re less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat a way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum in australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance cheaters aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights furthermore most of these women assault the men if it were round the other way the men would be in jail if it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters because they don t normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat men s mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway 
if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining then you re bound to enjoy surveillance this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a thriller is comical that would imply some kind of tension and twists you kept waiting for the story to actually finish starting it never rises above a glorification of weak minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of no country for old men without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters thrill killers run amok the acting is good mostly but the script is a pile don t bother and tell your friends to don t bother 
this p of s was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great similar to mine taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know i have no idea what they saw in this movie sadistic cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making or is it lowbrow highbrow the ancient generation gap clich no redeeming social value comes to mind bill pullman is trying maybe a little to hard and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self conscious and kinda lame save yourself from this and watch a double feature of in cold blood and the hitcher as somebody said this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch s daughter 
after a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy chainsaw massacre feeling everything falls apart spoiler alert as soon as the two fbi officers start jabbing you know they are the real killers anyone who have seen enough of these fooled ya movies can figure this out this movie is mader with one thing in mind to depict brutal murders why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well will this be next for us movie goers the torture and abuse of children whats wrong with you people lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind 
this is a snuff movie i m shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library and bill julia and all other professional actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent that usually make no sense when writing a horror film but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand this ending was not creative it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie i am shocked it was edited to this ending and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june it should not be shown in a theater it is harmful to innocent minds on many levels watch the movie the ending and you will understand this statement plus included in the plot is a sweet little girl not yet her character says she is not in the snuff ending but she is an integral part of the movie why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film 
i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i d be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here the fact that these inherent defects were a direct result of the film s low budget underground experimental nature is i d say beside the point anyway for those so inclined the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro understandably became an underground and gay icon the episodic structure showing the day to day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes his meeting with and eventually posing for an eccentric elderly artist the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective colleagues including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers a bespectacled nerd perhaps mercifully the film ran for only minutes against the imdb s claim that its complete length is but the latter could well be a mistake i had watched a few other of warhol s movies and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i ve run into yet bad and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler which were mostly a strain to sit through the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but as the saying goes you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two chapters had to follow in quick succession despite my generally negative reaction to it flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era both cinematically and in real life for the record an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths self titled debut album and transsexual candy darling who appears here rather unremarkably was immortalized in candy says the opening track of the velvet underground s eponymous album although the latter band is my all time favorite and one of the reasons for this is that through their sheerly unique and ground breaking music they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own this is truly a case where i d much rather experience something aurally instead of visually 
i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me but i think i have an idea one of the fat guys at the movies the person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest disturbing movies i m paraphrasing and doing this only by memory so forgive me if i misquoted at any rate i made the decision to watch it so i take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible predictable and stupid movies i ve ever seen strange i doubt i ve ever called a movie stupid but that was the first word that came to mind about one third in and stayed in my mind until the end where to begin unbelievable premise and reactions incredibly brain dead characters could blame the writing or the actors or i ll just blame both and enormously bad acting i d sooner believe bill pullman as president of the usa than a fbi agent here of course there s a reason for that and i ll partially go into that and to top it off if you can t figure the so called shocking twist in the first minutes then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late don t worry they ll tell you the twist every five minutes thereafter there s been some serial killer s on the loose in the most depressing town in the county or world but there s more to the story some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement could there possibly be more oh yeah there s a family well maybe not but there are four humans one boy one girl and an adult couple the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense there s gotta be more to this than what i mentioned that s what makes a movie interesting adding as many subplots that may may not be developed is the way to go okay then i ll continue we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh a pair of giggling druggies who s shocked at first their dealer od s but then resorts to robbery a gosh tooting great guy cop who must ve been put in for comic relief who s always battling an angry suspicious cop and finally poor poor michael ironside who didn t just phone his performance in he barely text it in none of these work they re all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks and believe me you ll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin in addition the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all i guess i m referring mostly to the cops but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks this stupid stupid movie stinks it s barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was unless his exposure has been limited to goosebumps stories and what s with the title surveillance oh i get it it s because it was used in subplots just to film interviews since that s so random it might as well been called cop car bullet or coffee just stay away from this horrid mess 
this movie was good relatively during the first parts of it we have a story from points of view so let s find some clues and complete the story oh wait none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys though that was a great twist it was almost a terrible twist i immediately downgraded the film from a maybe to based on the last minutes of it does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad yes it s a good shock but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes there s no connection to the killers the killers are in about all of minutes of this movie as killers and the two fbi agents are only in minutes of the previous hour and twenty we get it surveillance oh the killers are voyeurs which makes no sense because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in minutes all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous oh they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning what fbi agents sleep together all in the same room to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents a cop feet away apparently can t hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe the other thing is the movie ends about minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere 
significant spoilers this is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick twisted director jennifer chambers lynch who also wrote it i don t even know why i gave this movie a rating of it is not the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind i do know that i will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch she is a sick twisted foul mouthed foul thinking deviant she looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent years doing hard time you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of surveillance the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this movie i m not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any p rn film the level of implied sado violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p rn standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description i was seeking this is a snuff film be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this director writer is truly a sick person i can t believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that i will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind when i saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killers as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long term psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing film while the little girl stephanie ryan simpkins truly stole the show i can t believe that her real life parents would have tolerated this sick foul mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character i m stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer director who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert i m not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd this writer director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the director writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i m telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldn t be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family fortunately jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles i don t think we ll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out i d recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and i m not too sure her dad s films would be any better do yourself a favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch 
i went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it recognizing jennifer lynch s name and seeing the certificate i realised it might be disturbing in actuality i found the film a farce i found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it the acting is atrocious bill pullman and his ridiculous twitching face i do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction after some shocking incident there is plenty to try and shock the viewer in this film characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather everything was overstated or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious the performance from the little girl character named stephanie was the best thing about the film quiet and intense i really could not recommend this film to anyone its violent without point ridiculous characters bad acting bad script and plain silly 
i must say when i saw this film at a on this site i figured it was well worth a view i was sorely disappointed from nearly the opening scene it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are in fact the killers could they have made it any more obvious if that is the intended twist in this film that s pretty sad while pullman and ormond are excellent actors even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer and that s the problem there is no switch from i m playing fbi guy to i just killed people and boy are my arms tired you can t blame the actors the story fails in far more ways than one from the onset of the film however i was certain i was wrong that no director writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot twist ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer s attention from the real killers i thought which gave the film s makers far too much credit i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the minute mark to lynch s credit she did manage to interject many things that make a good film sex violence humor and well trained actors too bad they were in the wrong configuration hopefully pell james can recover from this role i found her performance particularly impressive as the stunning drug addict turned would be savior she should have rewritten the role so the crack whore would win those people who have compared this film to natural born killers take note tarantino made the characters of mickey and mallory reprehensible yet sympathetic the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore and this is not seen once in surveillance surveillance only wishes it were natural born killers in fact it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was folks who haven t seen surveillance stick to something with a little more intelligence like camp rock 
the film s executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation david lynch the director s father i wonder what david s guru his holiness maharishi mahesh yogi would have thought of this production the hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself it s a safe bet that samuel l dieteman phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence would have loved every minute of it i doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft on that level it s quite good but on a moral level it s the most disheartening movie i ve ever seen spoiler coming i guess it s the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most morally numb generation xers learn a craft and a little post modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts and entertainment industry and here s the result a film which wallows in human suffering injustice and carnage much of which is witnessed by a nine year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational violence killers who at the end ride off into the sunset no more spoilers coming for whom are films like this produced narurally sadists are going to adore this why wouldn t they but who else as i noted above there s some really good film craft here but good craft can be applied to any subject matter why apply it to stuff like this also the movie is very suspenseful but that s not because of the graphicness grossness of the violence it s suspenseful because it s well directed well acted i m sure the ghost of alfred hitchcock could explain this much better than i can so what has been put before us here and above all why yes our world can be an ugly dirty even evil place but shouldn t we dissent when an artist makes it her his business to rub our faces in it or worse still to stick it in the faces of those nine year olds who will one way or another end up seeing this on home dvd i hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids yeah i know dream on bernon 
sorry for all you guys that are not family with the lynches my sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie i told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces after every lnych movie i tell myself again one and a half hour lost of my life but next time i will check the director s or producers name so you don t want to be angry at yourself and loose time don t watch it but if you think that you need to kill someone watch it this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane 
this must be the worst thriller i have seen in a long long time the directing the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery i guessed this within the first few minutes and i kept hoping i was wrong and much to my dismay i was not the film starts off with two fbi agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses a young girl a drug addict and a cop they are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts this part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better spoiler the whole story ends in the fbi agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place how did they get away with pretending to be fbi agents when you discover that real fbi agents had been killed and their badges were found on them how did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras bill pullman and julia ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end come on they both look ridiculous stupid and not sinister in the least the character of the young girl is also wasted potential there is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal she does not appear distressed but rather detached which again is not explained awful film on the whole 
i do not know what today s movie goers expect but after years of movie watching well maybe i didn t watch many movies in the first years so make that years of movie watching i expect to be entertained not bored to tears assaulted by continuous profanity every other word and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have no imagination little if any talent a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on long after the purpose for it has elapsed that anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie when it is nothing more that hollywood garbage is beyond me as a combat veteran i have seen violence blood and gore in many forms and movies like we were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get but it has redeeming value surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor with no writing ability no directorial training no experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as fbi agents setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops etc a high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like 
without a doubt the biggest waste of film of the year this movie is poorly structured sadistic cruel and filled with unlikable characters on top of that and maybe the worst crime it s uninteresting and vastly predictable as soon as bill pullman s character doodled on the photo changing the word from evidence to violence i had the entire plot figured out there are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash the only redeeming feature for me is that i saw this thing for free on my hdnet cable and didn t waste any money i would truly be angry if i had paid to see it in a theatre anyone that labels this thing a thriller really needs to get out more an awful awful film in every way that matters 
it s hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of junk the show couldn t even hold a candle to cooking shows of the past including emeril lagasse rachael ray is the most annoying talk show and cooking show host in tv history not since ainsley harriott has had a terrible cooking show host i ve watched at least ainsley harriott has some good moments and some style this one has no style at all she s terrible as host the kitchen looks atrocious the writing is horrible the teleplay is over the top and the opening credits are so bad it makes me sick now i enjoy cooking shows that had a cool sense of style but this has absolutely none of that this is one of the worst tv of the year 
i of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other lion s gate extravaganza so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing and it is to a point a young college student sarah is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them and in doing so she s unwittingly becoming involved in some game now that s fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer like myself will most likely become frustrated characters appear with little introduction and you re not really sure who they are or why sarah knows them or is hanging out with them all of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it s all part of the design in reality it s all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over you ll find yourself feeling that you ve lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time like cleaning the bathroom for instance out of 
in the european tv industry movies like this one are called stickers tv stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to let s say titanic some not really blockbusters were a part of the deal hours is a story of a hospital its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low budget film newborn babies are very obviously not real there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor acting the actors are not believable in their roles their lines when spoken sound way too memorized as if this was a read out camera test 
i work at memorial hermann hospital tmc and was also working at texas children s hospital women s hospital and west houston during allison first the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban the texas medical center has a daytime population density similar to wall street there are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals tch was the largest children s hospital before it doubled in size twice methodist with its beds is one of the largest hospital in world the texas medical center skyline is bigger than that of memphis yet the best pics hollywood could muster are that of some dinky hospital in the middle of nowhere besides the real pic of the hospital taken decades ago also they combined several real life characters and portrayed them all in one super nurse i actually know the medical technologist s working in the blood bank two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant mt there was a pregnant mt and another mt that took the precious patient antibody rolodex research alloantibodies for more info i will not mention their names privacy there was no nurse in the real life lab scene hollywood combined these two techs most likely to save time and money in the movie military helicopters true had to transfer the our babies nicu and picu to utmb all the way to galveston why you may ask when we have the largest children s hospital just down the street because texas children s hospital refused to take them you read right they refused being employed by them i was ashamed needless to say i m no longer affiliated with that facility any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here or lived through the experience 
this movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going the first scene shows a life flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background for those of you who might not ever have been to houston there is no elevation change the city sits just above sea level and a ft incline is considered a big hill to go along with that scenery any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in houston the trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees neither of which houston has very much of even the hospital itself on the outside is very unbelievable memorial hermann hospital is one of the top hospitals in the united states and sits smack dab in the middle of the medical district just miles from downtown houston yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside it is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong the first radar image in the movie is that of hurrican hugo hitting south carolina we later see kris kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that alison is moving back south across houston yet the radar image he shows has alison clearly moving north off of the gulf of mexico into houston probably the initial landfall of alison as for the acting it isn t all that bad jobeth williams kris kristofferson and rick schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight to tv movie the plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining my one problem with the acting is the portrayal of houstonians with big thick southern accents the actors all sound like they are from birmingham alabama and not houston texas the movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to entertain if you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of houston in june of then you will be disappointed one thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of memorial hermann hospital and not on tropical storm alison and the impact on houston metro itself if you are looking for a factual account of tropical storm alison s impact on houston metro might i suggest watching the weather channel s storm stories for tropical storm alison out of 
upon a recommendation from a friend and my admiration of philip baker hall i rented the first season disc of the loop it s a typical tv comedy with all the clich s that the genre employs with the wacky scheming brother sully ditzy blonde lizzy token unrequited love interest piper sarcastic asian helper darcy which reminded me of arliss as if anyone needed to be reminded of that show the plot deals with various bad luck usually by sully that befalls sam that puts his job at the airplane in jeopardy only to have him save the day with hilarious hijinks ensuing in the middle i didn t descibe a certain episode i described them all to a t therein lies the problem as what seems like it might even be passable entertainment at first just gets uselessly stale when watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief at the endless repetition sully will do something wacky mimi rogers will say something overtly sexual russ will tell about his gay son darcy will do her impersonation of sandra oh on arliss blah blah blah blah blah the only positive is the lack of an annoying laugh track but don t let that fool you into thinking it s any good go watch a far better comedy arrested development always sunny in phillidelphia two name two off the top of my head surprised that this one is still on the air oh that s right fox only cancels the good shows i forgot needless to say i don t trust my friend s taste in shows anymore my grade d 
fox is pretty lame they cancel the wrong shows it s bizarre that they would cancel a well written program like arrested development and yet they keep this show and war at home i feel that fox loved that they broke barriers with the then edgy married with children but now it s just getting ridiculous the loop is a pointless and boring watch and their edgy jokes just fall flat in order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming family guy and the simpons work because there is a constant flow of jokes fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe i mean if you re going to invest money into making something entertaining make it entertaining also stop using no named actors it s great to have up and comers but you need to anchor a show with a noted celebrity duh fox 
the first season was great good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home it was actually a pretty funny show now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone and the whole thing revolves around the airline company even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill way too over the top where before it was perfect that and no more sarah mason one of the best looking girls in hollywood this is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show you can almost see the meeting the old man is funny lets focus on him make him way over the top and make it all about the airline it ll be a nutty version of the office anyhow no hot chicks no watch 
i am very open minded i watch all kinds of programs to the end good or bad just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones this show had potential to be good but my god what were the writers casting director and director thinking the cast of actors are terrible with the slightest exception of meryl mimi rogers and darcy joy osmanski being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot the rest of the cast kill the show it is the same story line in every episode sam has plans to do something his boss disrupts these plans by assigning him ridiculous work projects then the foolish ways sam tries to accommodate both in a manner that is primarily stupid and lacks any real intelligent humor this is every episode it gets very tiring season they ditch the eye candy the hot girls in the show get written out yet the brother stays explain that casting cut to me please i can see why they wrote them out they had no substantial role but they didn t add anyone better to replace them the cocky derek tricolli character is given a continuous appearance in season his acting along with everyone else s resembles many poor sitcoms from the s might have been funny then but painful now the show could have been so much better with a few good writers and some people who had any talent to execute them this show lacks everything production quality is the only good aspect of the show it is great in that regard unfortunately the content is painfully sad my god fox was there really nothing better to choose from i m sticking with shows like it s always sunny in philadelphia or rock for now the bar should be set by programs like these that actually assume the audience are intelligent and aren t continually drooling on themselves using all their brain power on continuing to breathe 
i love this show i watched every episode last year i bought the dvds and i tune into to watch tonight and i see for some reason you have retooled this great show and you have taken what made it work and ruined it you took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the friends sam sully lizzy and piper i love the other characters as well but they are good in small dozes like derek darcy and even sully it is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in it is overdose while things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying i was so looking forward to the return of this show so please bring back the charm even if you could not fit piper into the show at least bring lizzy back but i loved those girls they brought the fun the show was about sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well that was the charm and that great dog as well i hope the network fox forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show i will give the show a couple more episodes before i give up but tonight s episodes were bad i made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and i felt like a fool because no one was laughing except times i apologized to them and said i don t know what happened and about minutes into the episode i realized they were not going to show piper or lizzy and this was no longer a must see tv comedy 
wow there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is i usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad but this was just too much i would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device if you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror if your thinking about watching this because your a sandra bullock fan don t even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time and her acting is absolutely atrocious not to mention the rest of the cast which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job at least then we wouldn t have to listen to the terrible dialogue 
don t worry when looking at the cover of the dvd sandra bullock only appears at most minutes in total in this cult classic the entertainment value here is very high to name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to the doubled evil voices of the chief bad guys the special gun cam the weird masks and outfits of the hit killers the showy ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground the abundance of bottom up shots the spacey scene in which bullock falls unconscious on the street the over clich italian mob guy moe lamotta the cheap synthesizer background music the mesmerizing overdone gun fetishism and last but not least the super corny fist fight scenes wish there would have been more of those extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud 
it seems like if you are going to post here it going to be a star rating nobody ever seems to dislike anything well i am honest some don t like that but here we go rachel ray show is just plain awful this show reminds me of the snl character linda whatever if she had a cooking whatever show i must say i liked rachel on the food network on a day but i am sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out give me ham on the street anthony bourdain interesting folks but most of all i find her annoying she actually told a member of the studio audience to shut up yes in a kidding way but shut up is shut up and who cares about her pet stories sorry rachel you been cancelled 
oh boy oh boy on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her name written on top i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties was because of sandra bullock s name bullock s fans don t have to disappoint sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting rest of the movie it s fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it s bad but after that it s going worse much worse directing is awful acting is awful script is awful dialog is awful action is awful music is quite good actually typical score for eighties action movies this movie is so bad that it goes close to anything andy sidaris has ever produced it s so bad that there isn t proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie but still there was sandra bullock and super cool sarcasm jake lamotta who tried to be marlon brando i think they can now bring the film out on dvd it could be cool and they should write on the cover academy award winner sandra bullock in hangmen out of 
the prior comments are way to generous this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic on the other hand i have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as beyond belief no words can express how i feel about this this movie will move you as expected the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements they were wrong the sadistic pleasure i had foisting this on people was well worth the i paid for the movie on the other hand one former friend says i owe him minutes of his life back i particularly enjoyed the gun s eye view of parts of the movie truly awesome in it s absurdity 
found this film in a dvd discount rack for it wasn t worth it some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student sandra s performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged one thing that i will give them however unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition 
we also found this movie on the discount rack and made the mistake of purchasing it because sandra bullock was featured on the cover the cinematography was terrible and the back of the dvd box told more about the plot than the movie itself oh and i love the uzi cam not 
the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock her picture from years after this film basically is the cover art and the back cover art and the inside cover art the same picture her name is prominently shown on the front cover all edges and the disk itself she is the first name in the list of stars her biography is printed inside the case this film must revolve around her character right wrong it is her first movie and she plays a minor role after watching the movie every role seems like a minor role the character dog actually displays some personality less than an hour after watching it i don t even remember the names of many characters maybe if i watched it several more times i could actually figure out the plot but i don t think it would be worth the effort oh wait i just remembered a funny bit shoot em up video game fans will get a kick out of the doom cam looks just like a first person shooter game hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera i am generally not a person to be critical of movies but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen sit down and start making fun of it i m just glad that the money we spent on this used went to charity 
this film stinks more than limburger cheese if you find this at a garage sale leave it there i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie although ashamed i do own a copy and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all they play it up to be a sandra bullock movie she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that but she is young and had not learned her talent yet well everyone has to start somewhere 
i broke my own rule buying this movie from the bin at walmart basically if a movie has a big star in it and you ve never heard of it before it s usually for a reason well in the case of this movie the reason is because it sucked they plaster sandra bullock s photo and name all over the cover of the dvd as bait and it reeled this little fishie right on in i was thinking of donating the disc to charity or giving it to the library but i don t think i would want to subject anyone else in the world to this movie worst lines what do you mean army buddies what do you mean your dad 
my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for but since it featured sandra bullock who i generally like i bought it my disappointment with the film began almost immediately the dialogues are slow and stiff the color is distorted i kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations the acting is amateurish even the killing scenes are a failure twice dead people moved their legs when my cash deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie i immediately and joyfully complied this is an amazingly bad movie tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party 
i don t know how this dvd made its way into my collection my wife suggested it was one of these for deals at a high street store the thing isn t worth p let alone having invested heavily in it i felt duty bound to watch it to the end just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through and it was the dialog was awful the story line was impenetrable i still don t understand what the hell was going on despite having read the synopsis the camera work was disjointed and hopeless the acting was wooden not helped by the dialogue in fact there were no redeeming features no not even the lovely sandra bullock on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asap as a final amusing example of the director s ineptitude there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father s ex army sidekick while driving this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film no engine noise whatsoever i look forward to the engine damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars 
i watched of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it but frankly i don t think so what the hell is the story in this movie i saw a lot of people running around in a factory shooting at everything around them where to start okay they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill the entire place is made of metal but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces no ricochet metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet magic bullets in one scene a bad guy is standing right in front of a good guy when another good guy pops out behind the bad guy and pumps him full of metal you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist but the good guy right in front of him doesn t get hurt at all after having just splattered a human being all over the wall the two good guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft guns sound at one point the good guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm the lady screams out alarm in sector blah blah and the bad guy boss says okay this is not a drill blah blah in a very very amateur kinda way ooh we re getting ambushed by terrorists this isn t a drill but i m gonna sound like i don t give crap focus first you see the bad guys load up on weapons for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice deja vu or loop of scenes you literally see every single bad guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad guy extra no xx locks and loads when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes boooring actors or dummies one of the presumed good guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they re smoke blind or something so they don t see it coming they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade then a semi boss bad guy arrives and he doesn t even cough when he enters the smoke he just pushes the other bad guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn t anthrax anyway b flick i think yeah a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently i d like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and i d like to see him go get his hand afterwards extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way small pops and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead though the first bullet hit his heart the good guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip how stupid can you be always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies boring scenes like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building cut to the action if you re going for a b flick movie please my two cents on this movie 
here is a rundown of a typical rachael ray show the awful theme song begins to play and rachael descends wearing her snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator she begins running around screaming and or insulting the audience then yells at them sit down an awkward monologue the next are in any order a segment tooting rachael s own horn i e i lost pounds with rach s recipes rachael ray saved my life rachael s fashion tips a totally useless d i y tip i e how to engrave words into casserole dishes how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it the unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience reaction shots of first bites are never shown a celebrity guest with an awkward interview followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience a person who gets help from one of rachael s cronies i e the i say yes to everything woman the i own nothing but overalls lady and the i can t find time to put on makeup housewife what would they do without you rachael gasp reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague fakeness rachael ray claims that entire show is unscripted many people who have attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show her show jumps around too much where as oprah who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show rachael s jumps around like an adhd soda child on crack her show averages perhaps short worthless segments a show on second you will be getting fashion tips from kojo and the next rachael will be making gross stuffed spanish peppers with manchego cheese and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage and the next well you get the picture rachael is a poor host with bad ideas aside from her grating personality rachael s hosting ability is terrible at best her questions for her celebrity guests are poor and often times not even relevant to the interview and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational or humorous value in conclusion you need not waste your time with this schlock it will be canceled soon anyways 
i saw this one remastered on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so she s barely in it she does what she can with the script but that s not much the sound was awful by that i mean things didn t go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didn t correspond to the sound people talking in a car while it s moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there s no motor noise road noise or any other sound kind of weird score was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful acting was awful i couldn t believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the biff and bam they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with firearms were laughable literally i fast forwarded through a lot of this movie even then it was too long 
i checked this out for free at the library and i still feel ripped off yes sandra bullock is actually in it but only in five scenes totaling up to barely minutes and even those are fairly painful to watch the rest of the movie is so bad that you ll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon but only if you re one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it everyone else will just turn it off don t worry you aren t going to miss anything bullock s lines assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case are essentially just parroting of other characters lines like this dialog lisa bullock danny please tell me what is going on danny i don t know lisa whaddaya mean you don t know danny i don t know it s something to do with my dad lisa whaddaya mean your dad danny i don t know he ed up or something lisa why am i here danny i m sorry lisa i don t know moments later danny some army buddies of my dad lisa whaddaya mean army buddies see what i mean bottom line just say no 
the dvd version we bought had sandra bullock on the cover but we ve discovered it was a picture of her from another movie unfortunately she is in this movie very little you can however see how far she has come the one other bright spot in the movie besides her very small part were a few of the location scenes shot in nyc and new jersey in the s the sound is terrible sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all which is disconcerting for example sometimes when they are in the car the noises from the car are too loud and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all the director is fond of close ups on faces and then it s clear that the movie has been over dubbed because the words don t match the lip movements through most of the movie the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can background music when there is music is distracting instead of adding to the movie the direction is laughable goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke especially during times when there is supposed to be tension like in the middle of gun battles the writing is terrible there are some subplots that make no sense and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations the writer director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam but none of it makes sense these top assassins and former soldiers don t seem to be able to see other people s shadows or hear other people moving the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning it s simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing the production values are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled on someone s student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it if you like laughing at really poorly done student films then this movie is for you otherwise avoid this movie 
wait until you ve watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when you re ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody s imagination i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten star production has to be doing it to skew the data anything above would be odd nice to see the very young sandy bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured though she overdid the new yorker accent but other times her southern virginia nc accent did sneak through ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film the dvd i rented had two bonus features a mini bio section that only featured sandra s bio taken verbatim from imdb it also had a trivia quiz as a bonus questions hope you get them all right 
i walked into blockbuster itchin to watch some good old fashion action movies so i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter sandra bullock an action movie with sandra bullock in it and it s rated r yay although i will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like speed then i was sold sadly sandra really is not in this movie her role is minor panicky kidnapped girlfriend she is in fifth place on the actors listing for jeebus shakes apparently this was her first movie role and after watching this movie i figured as much sandra is the only living human in this movie everyone else might as well be a zombie in a b horror flick this movie deceived me saying sandra was the lead i fell for it like biff from back to the future when marty yells what s that god i wish i watched that instead of this sandra is the only bright side of this movie every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling clear to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries more on sandra later the movie is dull very dull think of the dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for minutes for me it is this movie this movie even somehow makes gun fights and bullet time effects boring so boring that elephant tranquilizers are put to shame and this movie s idea of bullet time is a close up of an ak in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away and i knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding through the action the plot there was a plot music even by s muck standards is bad but at least it s the one thing that kept me awake acting sandra bullock was good and ummm moving on is it any good since it is rated r no unless r stands for ridicules snooze fest and it is really s clich when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city rocking guitar licks or power ballet and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes both of which this movie satisfies at least this movie establishes what era it s from which was unnecessary since sandra s hair was screaming s and a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box which you respond to sadly saying that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got another hammy moment is at the beginning when some secret agent dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die all that scene needed was the mario death ditty or maybe contra sound effects but nintendo might have sued and it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other better movie icons before the big gun scene da hero is found standing in a boxing ring rocky anyone sporting a leather fedora not indiana jones too with an ominous spotlights behind him terminator the nd before owning t what is really really sad is that people on youtube or dailymotion can film better quality videos with a crappy webcam no less then this movie i m serious most rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie i cannot even call this movie by it s given name for it s very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment a freaking violation against human rights the only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is sandra s career started taking off thanks to this movie but oh sandra why did you have to be in such a nightmare the paycheck better been worth it the dvd also graces you with a little back story on sandra as an extra seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs crafty little critter i don t have much experience with bad films but i know bad when i see it i could bounce back from mazes and monsters with a good old campy bruce willis comedy but not even bruce could cheer me up after this movie i have yet to see any ed wood or uwe boll but i think i m amped for them now for i can t even fathom a movie worse then gag hangmen 
i give it a i reserve a rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films we don t even remember what this movie was about the only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting it was like watching year olds with broken legs trying to perform the stunts also when the characters were driving in a truck the engine noise or radio can t recall would vanish entirely when the actors were talking and like others we bought it because of the sandra bullock front cover very sad very bad 
i love sandra bullock she s one of my all time favorite actresses but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash canned i realize that it s almost years old but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did beware it s not even worth the walmart rack you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it s not even worth a couple of bucks the sound quality is horrendous there s no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog and it looks as if it were filmed on a budget i thought that i d like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress but yikes is too kind a word to use 
this movie is soo bad that i ve wasted way to much time already talking about it soo bad really bad and i m not even that critical i m almost ashamed to admit to having seen it sandra s few minutes show you how far she s really made it i mean really anything next to this is really oscar worthy for her i suppose the only way for her to look at it is there s no way but up after this one i suppose she had to start somewhere but really soo bad awful really bad is too good a word for this s t but i don t want to get mean now but really how can u not after wasting minutes minutes of my life that i ll never get back minutes i could have spent doing something better like sitting on my butt and staring into space that would have been time better spent walks away shaking head 
what can i say after i say the one line summary sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it can t save it way too much pre occupation with guns how can the hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns it s just worse than expected 
this movie is in the list of worst movies i have ever seen with lessons for an assassin on the spot the acting is lousy sorry sandra bullock but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad x rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous it had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one syllable words but contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one boring the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie thumbs down on this one 
although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society i don t object to the extremely high salaries for many of today s entertainers and athletes a rod lebron or brady all have deals either well with figures or the low area ray romano and jerry seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows huge residuals and fees they currently demand even their cast members and all of the friends group reached near or over figures per episode letterman s earnings for one show could solve most people s financial problems and a week or two s take care of many for life but all of these are based upon sound supply demand principals and the financial benefits they bring to their employers and all perform their crafts ably but then comes along someone like rachel ray who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill i find her shrill annoying and with a forced perkiness that s as phony as the proverbial dollar bill a friend of mine is responsible for special meetings events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates one of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the k level to a handful who get k and up per appearance this area includes trump seinfeld lance armstrong robin williams and no kidding larry the cable guy there are a greater number in the range list included the likes of bill cosby steve martin and even cable guy larry s benefactor jeff foxworthy this category includes rachael ray i suppose i have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her talent and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who ll pay more than k first class air hotel suite all expenses and limos door to door for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization s event i just can t figure how in the hell this could be possible 
sandra bullock is my favorite actress but this movie was so horrible i couldn t help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that i was actually watching something so crappy ha ha the audio editing is horrible they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles because they re just weird and stupid the script sucked acting was horrible storyline not very good very unrealistic even for a movie but it is a year old movie so i ll give it a bonus point for that and yeah the music was terrible but we all got to start somewhere and submitting these things is such a hassle line minimum bother well now i know why i couldn t find this movie in the movie store i had to purchase it offline to see it good thing it was only cents even though shipping was oh well i don t recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film 
notable only as the acting debut of future big time hollywood starlet sandra bullock this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect termite infestation the storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out the production values stink of cheese in fact a total lack of production values would have been better at least the film might have seemed grittier that way the adr is laughably bad and omni present in the film it s debatable as to whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used the performances are for the most part horrible though there are a few exceptions in those exceptions however the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times i e characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye bad direction also the constant weapon sound effects magazines being loaded slides being cocked etc are completely overused and more often than not totally out of sync with the on screen actions add to this cheesy bad guy vocal distortion for the lead villain mainly so that you know he s the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film and you have a recipe for disaster the situations in the film go well beyond standard suspension of disbelief and become downright laughable one lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he decides to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself so my questions are why didn t he do this sooner and why does he even have the butterfly knife he wasn t searched right this is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this minute package in whole the hangmen plays like an unbearably bad r rated tv movie from the s if not for the subsequent success of sandra bullock this would have never found its way to dvd but it has so my only advice is to steer clear watching this film may actually impair your iq 
i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws example the background car sounds audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog s car production shows a total lack of imagination example slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part completely unnecessary to the plot to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting this film was released in not as the imdb database indicates and then current high tech was an amber screen on a mhz ibm pc with floppy drives maybe the pc was the real star of the movie at least it was interesting we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart as the other reviewer notes we paid too much 
this movie is from the s but it looks like it was made in the stone age the effects are way too cheesy my copy has sandra bullock on the cover which was why i bought the movie she was in the movie for about minutes of total screentime she would most likely deny all involvement in short there is no part of this movie worth seeing except to laugh at how bad it sucks rent this to see the worst film ever made bar none 
but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst of all time i got this dvd cheap with sandra bullock as headliner on the case this is false advertising she s on screen for almost minutes of the movie on the other hand there was no other selling point for this movie the dialog was horrible the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes the directing was well let s just say that my yo daughter could do better but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me it s possible that the family cat could have done better sandra does a creditable job for a first film in the short time she s on screen and that s the only redeeming quality of this film stupid story poorly written and transferred to film as only a th grade media class should be able to do in short this is dreck 
if you have ever shopped at wal mart then you probably know about the dvd bin that sits by the electronics department well that is where i found this movie however i was tricked you see the cover of this particular dvd had a big picture of sandy bullock on it and even listed her name as a headliner i picked it up thinking wow i didn t know sandra bullock did this movie so i was pumped to go home and watch a cool sandra bullock movie much to my surprise ms bullock had a small role very small role she plays the girlfriend of the son of the cia agent talk about supporting actress she may have had no more than lines in the movie besides being deceived of this being a bullock flick i looked past that and i continued to watch an action packed film negative at one point for special effects a gun was taped to the camera you gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is 
i won t go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating plenty of other people have already done that suffice it to say that out of the over movies that i ve owned on dvd this is the only one that i got rid of it was so worthless that i couldn t see ever wanting to watch any of it again however i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of as of while skimming through the pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than stars looking at the voting history of users rated the movie as stars or less it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb bottom list it would be interesting to see how many of the users who rated this movie as stars none of who wrote a review of the movie are actual active users don t be fooled this movie isn t worth your time 
i hafta watch crap like this all the way through to see if there are any redeemable qualities whatsoever to justify including it in my clients video libraries don t you watch this not even a minute of it unless someone has a gun to your head you will as i did moan groan at least times and pray that one of the one dimensional characters all played by really bad actors would turn and shoot you dead even if you are the biggest sandra bullock fan in the world it is not worth even watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears i want to kick the asses of the sleazy marketing people who put sandra s huge picture on the face of this dvd box and have them thrown in jail for mugging me or something like that i really wish i had the chance to read a review of this film before i bought it please give me a call and i will pay you to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it stinks up the whole place just kidding please don t call 
this forth film in the angel guts saga which at only a few minutes above an hour it just feels much longer is also the shortest which is perhaps just as well as it s also the most uninvolving of the series nami a department store clerk is interested in another part time job her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called red porno but when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her and she gets some unwanted admirer oh yea and she likes to masturbate alot using various household items the wall to wall sexcapades masks a lack of discernible plot and pushes this one far too much into exploitation territory not unsurprising though given that the director of this one is toshiharu ikeda evil dead trap beautiful prey perhaps his sensibilities just weren t suited for an angel guts film my grade d dvd extras commentary by jasper sharp bio filmographies a minute interview with toshiharu ikeda original sleeve art and trailers for this and other angel guts films high school co ed red classroom red vertigo red porno all available in artsmagik s box set but for some reason the th film angel guts red flash is not in the set
despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes this entry the fourth feels tired toshiharu ikeda who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film evil dead trap shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot predictable stalking harassing assault and rape ensues the staple of roman porno is sex and sex mixed with violence both potentially exciting subjects to be sure but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening via condom is too little kink to late the series rain motif continues and the film s final scene brings relief 
i love documentaries the andy goldsworthy doc was great i looked forward to this one but was very disappointed i knew of kahn and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a penn station men s room there must be a story here i mistakenly believed the only story here is of sadly deluded women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man in the absence of anything like an explanation for this guy s horrible behavior we re given endlessly repeated clips of kahn walking around and painfully long supposedly contemplative shots of his soulless buildings actually some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself the overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film kahn s apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr his mistresses this film seems to want to give kahn the great artiste s free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures i don t buy it 
i am currently years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out you heard me right i was years old and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twain s creativity no on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about mark twain s dark depressed and in fact suicidal side one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeral would an adult enjoy this film well this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twain s writing might enjoy but trust me on this adventures is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain 
i attended a screening of this movie it was wrought with clich s and very unfunny jokes and set ups i think the other comments were by people who must ve worked on the movie or been family members of the cast i m amazed this movie cost million without any real stars where did the budget go it obviously didn t go to writers for re writes nice thought to bank on the success of big fat greek wedding but a major miss there was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best the direction was uninspired and looked like a student film i don t even know what it means everybody wants to italian is that a real saying i ve never heard it 
far from combining the best bits of pontypool and days this managed to ignore them whilst shamelessly copying them if that makes sense pontypool was different and got progressively tenser this just stinks the radio dj we must stay on air spends effectively no time on air he sits on his bottom and watches the tv for news this is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever is there a single person in the usa or indeed the world who doesn t know what a zombie is or ever heard of the word zombie well by the th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies the infected ones or the ones with rabies the word zombie might make a guest appearance later i could care less maybe there s a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words like the bluetooth earphone is called the ear thingy i kid you not to finish no plot no acting no one cares a waste of time a shameless poorly executed rip off 
stealing is a crime and these guys kenny yakkel and corbin bernsen look like their going to get away with it i haven t even seen this film but not only do i know it sucks but the fact that it steals the story of another film or films for that matter is such bull crap and if imdb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap that i become filled with rage and feel as though i should just throw myself out the window and just end it all o k that s a little much but stealing is worse ever seen pontypool it was this awesome little zombie film made in this radio host goes into work and then this zombie attack happens we only see what s going on inside the radio station and the only guess we have on what s happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky ken loney easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind and the bbc calling in for an update on the situation from all the reviews i ve read and from the conversation i had with my friend who has seen this film and pontypool this film was exactly like it in the story with minor tweaks here and there so throw originality and creativity out the window as for the zombies or the infected whatever you want to call them they are the exact same thing just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly and have a never ending quench for flesh they are zombies zombies zombies okay one to many but back to this crappy movie the zombies from what i ve heard are a lot like the ones in days later another better movie with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh this is where zombie movies define themselves story does not matter in a zombie movie as long as your not taking the idea of another film sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story as is the case with pontypool but the zombies have to be in a way original days later started the insane raging zombie pontypool i can t even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film the evil dead i think all i have to do is just type the name again because come on it s the evil dead romero is the master and he went through all different types of zombies from the painted face zombies in dawn of the dead to raging zombies in diary of the dead and he did each one with his own unique style so after talking about other great zombie movies i think it s about time i explain why i hate this movie without even seeing it this movie down right steals the original story outline to pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing yet in hollywood it s allowed and apparently approved of this is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie and just tries to tell it differently the s is like the worst period for movies ever sure it had some gems but what decade doesn t and it s because all the movies were the exact same my favorite the crime movie with a twist so big that you ll never guess it till the very end they force feed you one suspect make it seem impossible that it s not anybody else but him then bam all this time it was this guy you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn t there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue say hey guys what did i miss oh didn t see that coming did ya well i ll leave a clich as my closing statement this is one film you ll surely want to miss 
corben bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters we watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports its has moments but mostly it plays like a lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood there are some really good ideas here but they just don t work actually the film s ideas are better handled in a film called pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything this shows us stuff and it just seems cheap given the choice i d watch pontypool again rather than watch this film again 
the idea behind dead silence is great zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show there was so much going for this film unfortunately as soon as the zombies made their appearance all was lost the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy b flick horror will enjoy it the zombies were soooo stupid they ran around flailing their arms they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students i know this is a brief review but i just don t see the need to invest much into this it s a dumb movie you ve been warned 
i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick the shonky production values and low rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci fi channel style knock offs the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever the cinematography is dull flat and completely uninspired like so many of these kind of films it doesn t even manage a decent bit of convincing gore the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film the film tries to inject originality and a message into it s concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a year old as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion describing all people of a certain skin colour as muslims most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone at the same time the muslim terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype presumably the far far superior pontypool had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably 
hard to believe but it is i shouldn t be surprised commercials try to show how unique and funny a show can be yet not only didn t the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me i ve not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing either i don t recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness cuteness or humor the characters were insufferable for the most part especially selma blair s which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this the few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all and this is not one of them kath and kim has exactly one redeeming quality and that s selma blair despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between britney spears paris hilton and kim kardashian selma is still nice to look at but if you want to look at selma go rent hellboy you ll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her all in all kath and kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that tv is or ever has been it sets a new low 
need i say more the reason the good australian version of kath and kim was as mentioned good was because of it s hilariously funny originality the reason this new american ised version is so terrible is because a lot of it is taken straight from the original not to mention the unfaithfulness to the characters kath is meant to be a dag kim is meant to be fat kel or phil as they have dubbed him is meant to be pathetic brett or craig is meant to be a loser not a person who acts like he s on heroin and finishes every sentence with dude thank god szubanski didn t sell her rights to sharon she d probably end up being a tall thin blonde who kim likes kath and kim are mother and daughter they are not meant to look years apart and they are not meant to giggle like school girls this show is a disgrace to even share the same title as the australian version america get your own television shows 
i ve tried watching it twice though i haven t been able to make through either episode for me it s basically just not funny i can tell where i m suppose to laugh but i can t i ve never seen the original so i m not comparing i also love comedies including off the wall comedies like married with children and family guy but this show just doesn t do it for me the jokes are lame and flat and the acting is mostly annoying the commercials made it look interesting but it isn t they re trying too hard to be different and tying to force the humor that style usually doesn t work too well i don t think this show finishes the season of course i could be wrong 
some ugly weirdo who had three families cheated on and neglected all of them built ugly useless buildings all over which are now unappreciated and crumbling his bastard half jew son runs around interviewing random jewish senile people who we care nothing about and shows his dreadful narrating and writing skills while tragic piano music plays this goes on for almost two boring hours and amounts to nothing all you shallow hippie people who watch these stupid documentaries eating salads and yogurt think all this crap is so important it s not save the whales no one cares 
the original australian kath kim is brilliant why do american producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show remember the original version of the office with ricky gervais it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it the producers said that the british humour from the office and the australian humour from kath kim would not translate to an american audience what so basically they are saying that americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with over the top childish gags so that the americans can understand the humour the original australian version of kath kim is fantastic and very funny avoid the american version like the plague 
it isn t too bad but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has the jokes are few and far between the actors are attractive they shouldn t be the film makers think far too much about the cinematography it s supposed to look like a home video and it s just like a serious version of kath and kim it s stupid it s too normal to be kath and kim kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy middle aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes there are no look at me kimmy jokes the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she s not even slightly stupid she s a stereotypical black latino chick it s just not as stupid or funny as the australian series it doesn t compare nothing is the same i admit this show is pretty funny at times but it is not anything like the aussie series i was looking forward to an american take on a bogan family they failed it s supposed to be really stupid and hilarious but the actors don t act stupid to me this is just a typical american tv show it s a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show stars because it is an okay show just nothing like what it should be 
the best thing i can say about the american version is that jane turner and gina reilly must be raking in the money for this crap yes the american rip off was shown for about two episodes in australia but didn t rate probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be answer deplorable a complete waste of time the actors are relatively unknown and they don t take readily to the nuances of the australian written script bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey my advice to usa viewers is don t americans should be best advised to find dvd s of the original version on ebay but be aware that some dvds are in a different zone format to those issued in the usa otherwise some dvd players will operate discs from both all zones 
i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performance i have watched the original from it s early days on big girls blouse to the last series on channel seven kath and kim was a great mocumentary and it s humor is something that most people get however in this american version i found it to be dull molly shannon is to fashionable to be kath day kath s wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the s with her frizzy perm while selma blair s figure hugging clothes isn t as good as what the original kimmy wore i also found that selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot she is obviously a australian size where kim should be australian a size the exchanges from molly and selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn t be pauses or the pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses it s like molly and shannon are not used to each other there is no mother daughter chemistry phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like kel however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie version i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of selma s expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes especially her sulking scenes to sum up i find this show to be a waste of time the script obviously has been dumbed down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original if nbc wanted to show kath and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original all i can add is magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon 
me being from australia and loving the series i wasn t expecting much from the american version of kath and kim but i thought i d watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad well whats there to say its nothing special selma blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines molly shannon is not a good kath though the good thing about jane turner s kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents such as when she says yumor or noice it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as turner and the show really misses sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the kal and craig characters in this version are really not funny so far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better but if there is nothing else to do on a sunday night or thursday night in america then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the aussie version if you ve got it 
there is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it in the writing the jokes are few and far between and the story lines are a bore so i figure it must be the physical comedy and the visuals i do enjoy the camera movement set dressing and wardrobe it s amusingly highly contrasted against the dullness that reigns and i m pretty sure every time i have laughed it was because of john or molly s physical comedy the two of them make a sickeningly cute couple that make me laugh and want to puke at the same time so here i go ready to sit down to kath kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down or up as the case may be looking forward positively 
i m a fan of this generally excellent though sometimes rather dull show but season has taken some terrible plot directions the episode hero is an example of what i mean the story as it eventually unravels is that the cylons deliberately allow bulldog a pilot captured several years earlier during a black ops mission to escape steal a cylon ship and get back to galactica the plan is that when bulldog gets back he will figure out that adama left him to his fate and be so enraged that he will kill adama which he very nearly does now the problem is this the cylons set it up so that bulldog thinks he has escaped by himself this means that bulldog gets off the cylon ship with no assistance so he kills a cylon and walks out of his holding cell that much we see then we must suppose that he walks to the flight hangar manages to get into a cylon fighter ship and learn how to operate it takes off and flies back to galactica just like that now starbuck managed to get one of them working in season one which was barely believable in itself but she only had to fly it visually out of orbit before making contact with galactica bulldog has to programme his ship so that it makes several jumps through hyperspace and manages to catch up with galactica somewhere thousands of light years away in an unknown direction how does he manage to programme a ship that contains completely alien technology cylons connect to their computers by touch there are no visual consoles or keyboards and having managed that miraculous feat how does he then know where galactica is bearing in mind that galactica took off some years before and is trying ever since to evade the cylons it does not leave beacons behind even allowing for the suspension of disbelief that must apply to any sci fi show this episode still absolutely no sense whatsoever 
some people say this show was good in it s early years i disagree with all of em the show is just plain stupid and pathetic my mum hates it i hate it my dad hates it i don t know about my sister but oh well here some reasons why the characters babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid the babies are just precocious and annoying the grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing the worst character is that angelica pickles she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long hard and miserable day at the office and also that kimi finster who appears later on she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt she can t decided whither she is french or japanese it doesn t matter know you are a american citizen know and that s that oh what am i talking about all the characters from this show suck the stories the stories are unoriginal and dumb the make it like the babies go off on a great adventure yeah to the back yard shed in one episode that little goofy brat tommy pickles the leader broke in to a television s control room and literally almost destroyed it don t give kids any idea to smash up normal t v station s control rooms they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life i can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in sad over rated the show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin offs for this get off the simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies the show is just plain over rated people where is your common sense anyway i surprised t v stations across the world want to air this series even off today the show is utter junk and should have never been produced the two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same 
cruddy innocent no smoking drinking or bikers but jeremy slate good actor and jocelyn lane good actress make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick post biker exploit time they knew it we knew it adam roarke and slate are wasted but they lived on a out of best performance jocelyn lane lane is the only really to catch the final exploit biker film after run angel run which also has good actors like don stroud etc it was over they knew it they were trying to make a living but jocelyn lane from two elvis bad flicks tickle me and something bad one in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with j slate fighting for honor it s worth seeing but it sucks but check it out well worth non biker non smoker non boozing biker types with hot chicks 
i ve read the positive comments on this movie i assume people who were in this movie must ve come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why i watched this whole movie but i don t think i laughed even once during the duration of this film the jokes were mostly very bad but when the jokes had some promise the delivery was off if you liked it maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the or brain cells you have left this movie had a poor script bad acting poor directing weak plot nothing of virtue and was not entertaining if you haven t seen this movie don t 
a frustrating documentary louis kahn s son who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life it sounds like a great idea for a documentary but it ends up flat and uninteresting sadly the basic problem is that kahn s son nathaniel is not just one of the film s protagonists he is also director writer producer interviewer and narrator nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles further while he seems like a nice enough guy he doesn t have much screen presence so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uh huh as if he s a little panicked that he s going to have to come up with something to say in response at times i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation nathaniel s dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahn s personality and career presumably because it s not clear from nathaniel whether he s looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama aren t you angry mom and don t offer much in terms of helping us or nathaniel understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand not to exclude nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience an independent director could have stood away from the material given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and one hopes cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don t work such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with kahn s first cousin who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer ahhh huh thaaat s nice sir umm i gotta go now i understand why these things might be important to nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personal as an aside i thought the score written for the film was great but one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when during the tour of the kimball art museum the voice over quotes kahn as making a comparison between architecture and beethoven s fifth symphony the music being played at the same time beethoven s ninth symphony a mistake a miscue who knows it did make me laugh kahn was a great architect and it s clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story there s definitely a good documentary to be made about him one is sympathetic to nathaniel s search for the father he didn t know but i m not sure whether that is an interesting story neither works so well in this film 
yes i admire the independent spirit of it all but it s like road trip with a bad cast and no budget i chuckle when i watch american comedies i don t laugh this movie made me laugh but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high budget american high school pot flicks if you want good independent american comedy with pot references go watch kevin smith or richard linklater flicks or something don t waste your time on this piece of sh t movie i mean how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot and by the way in norway it s called dude where s my pot 
i mean nothing happens dumb kids go to oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana this could ve been fun if it hadn t been for the worst actors in the world and the dialogs weren t even half an inch of fun the only thing that i almost showed my teeth of was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either oklahoma or kansas the plot could have been fun had it not been for abysmal interpretation if you even think about watching this piece of crap movie don t how dumb is it that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he s gay like his friend did just that he wasn t pretending and there s that dumb hick joke about the several meanings to the word gay i m laughing my hair off not anyway worst movie i ve ever seen 
this movie was extremely disappointing i thought it would be another marijuana comedy but don t be mislead it s not at all there are barely any weed related jokes that come to mind i don t even think they smoke any weed in this movie the marijuana field is merely a plot device my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of their idea of witty dialog and make a movie the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting to say this movie has no hook is a huge understatement don t waste your time or money 
 or better yet watch fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick rolling kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it out of stars which usually means it s fairly watchable but i pretty much fast forwarded through it usually road trip movies have great music but i can t even recall whether there was music the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old hitchhiker guru otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way the four main characters are unknown actors and i don t remember seeing any of them in another movie oh yeah i see that thos hayden church was in it but he s in everything good bad or indifferent this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you re not 
every time i see a film like this i get sick to my stomach when i watch a movie i like to see what i see in everyday life as i go through my day i see blacks whites asians latinos etc how do you cast a film and don t even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you i m sure they didn t do it on purpose but pay attention i don t care if it takes place in kansas or south central all i saw was one token black this was typical in the s hey it s with all the rappers singers and athletes working as actors thomas haden church could have paid more attention to his cast aren t actors supposed to be more liberal 
this movie is retarded a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage thomas hayden church should not direct anymore especially this movie which is a waste of film people who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people on here some are just retarded and don t watch movies so they think that any bad movie is good the actors suck and the movie sucks balls i think that many people are going to be upset because this movie tries to make itself look like the ultimate weed movie when it is just the worst movie about weed that i have ever seen i hope that people will stop the director from directing crap like this even weed cannot make this movie funny or entertaining 
this film has some flaws and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening possibly the greatest film to show the direness within fly over country rolling kansas is a film in which nothing happens and you don t care about anybody like life it starts it moves and then it ends a few attempts at humor are made but everything falls very flat the occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance do yourself a favor and go see a good movie this is free and repeatedly frequently on comedy central because nobody went to see it nobody wants to see it and it s marginally better than dead air not to damn with faint praise but the movie s one rock song is worth listening to too bad the movie isn t worth watching 
this one and the one prior toulon s revenge and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice it is basically choose your series the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers while the next three are a series of them being the good guys this one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and i never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series basically a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action japanese shows like ultraman the movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie you do get to see the guy who played toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins 
so i decided to watch the entire puppet master series and had just watched parts which i thought were all excellent they had a unique charm to them and a certain intelligence that i really appreciated about a year ago i even saw puppet master vs demonic toys which of course was bad but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch from the very beginning of this film i knew it was in trouble the cheesy power rangers style egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets rita repulsa style through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field all of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films i seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was being penned the writers had visions of someday seeing an egyptian power rangers villain totem monsters annoying twenty somethings who seriously can t act and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent and a lame decapitron puppet who s head can morph into the ghost of toulon another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry part ii since iii was a prequel suddenly the puppets are back at bodega bay inn back in their case minus blade and toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again he betrays them in part ii for his love of elsa this isn t explained at all and so with that and all of this other junk thrown in i was no longer amused i m a huge fan of ridiculous b movies a connoisseur if you will i even collect laser discs of rare b movies you can t find on dvd and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies i have ever seen in my life i still love those puppets the original ones blade tunneler pinhead jester and the rest and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn t broken well the series might still be alive and in good health that being said even though the reviews aren t so great i m really interested in checking out puppet master retro sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes 
a severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing guy rolfe so fantastic as andre toulon in part three barely features this time and richard band s fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film for the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of bodega bay inn gordon currie and some youth friends of his many of the cast are canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles teresa hill is quite yummy totems minions of the egyptian god sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets when they surface act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking totems the totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique they don t share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don t really fit in top scene is pinhead using a rag to clean blood from tunnelers drill bit classic and about the goriest this film goes the fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era or even galaxy guy rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do grrrrrrr 
try as i might i just simply couldn t get into this one perhaps it was the washed out tones perhaps it was the drawn out approach i m not really sure but though this was by no means a bad movie i didn t really find it to be very much of an effective movie words that i understand are so much more arbitrary than their common uses so basically the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town triggering a witch hunt what do the boys death have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who has appeared in town is the crazy hermit woman involved is it voodoo the story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensues good enough but to me most of it fell a little flat oh it had it s moments the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter commentary even if the effects themselves failed considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with red hot irons my biggest issue was the ending i ve already put spoiler tags on this review but be warned here s the big spoiler i don t believe it i don t believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier with other boys with a history or some other personal affect the movie didn t really earn its ending end spoilers nonetheless fulci is a big name and i m more than certain there s an audience out there for this i definitely need to check out more that he s done because this may have been a poor introduction most italian giallo is hit or miss anyway so i m waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him off polarisdib
i m a big fan of the demonic puppets looking at the surface of this one it looks pretty good you ve got decapitron the puppets and a new villain in the totem unfortunately the little punk that s doing this project to animate inanimate objects can t act he stinks his girlfriend is worse if they were left out it would probably be cool blade vs the totem i d watch that for hours but instead the puppets role is down played and the whole movie suffered because of it the mystical skull guy who created the totem is corny at best and decapitrons appearance is long awaited short and really quite disappointing you d be better off watching the first one again 
 slight spoilers this installment of the full moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements first off a new puppet master is established secondly the puppets turn good in this sequel finally it introduces some scifi fantasy elements as well a new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay his girlfriend her psychic friend and that psychics boyfriend stumble upon andre toulon s puppet trunk they also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving so sutekh the demon sends the totems a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear less gremlins then it s up to the puppet troupe to take care of the inter dimensional threat that s trying to kill there new friends like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems how did the puppets get put back in the trunk how come nobody remembers the last rasche of killngs in the hotel who bought the hotel why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders all this and many more questions will not be answered ever the real suprise of this movie is the acting it s actually pretty good the actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of full moon nonames teresa hill was especially impressive as the shy nervous psychic lauren chandra west susie was also a pleasant suprise also gordon hill was a tolerable protagonist but cameron was far too annoying to stomach thank the norse god he dies before halfway through the puppets are there usual animated selves with some improvements as well there emotions especially jester s are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them blade s hisses pinhead s grunts and six shooter s snicker have all been improved and sound much better the stop motion animation is only average at best especially the totems they just don t seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series also the sutekh costume is absolutely awefull how are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking the story seems a bit juvinile for the series i think charlie band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic the violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same gore fans will be disappointed i think the above is the main problem this movie can t really stick with many people it doesn t have the violence for gorewhores the language is a little cleaner yet it s too violent and harsh for the wee ones which is why the movie gets low ratings i have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair 
i absolutely love the first three movies they were great i once caught part on vhs years ago and i was disappointed but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one because they were shot back to back but after finally viewing a copy today i have to say it was no way better than number my expectations weren t high to begin with but this is cheap direct to video stuff not even a horror movie it s pg the acting was not convincing the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight but come on surprisingly both parts and were directed by sequel director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface texas chainsaw massacre iii i liked puppet master the legacy even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies overall puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series a great trilogy but forget the rest 
being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled unfortunately the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city ignoring the rest of the country while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan the men interviewed here are the same a list queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the s and here they are again waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics such as race ageism the burgeoning gay caste system based on wealth body image and the rise of the clones discrimination of sub groups within the community and the ability to grow a decent mustache which was very important in the s alas we have none of this presented and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories if you were there in that decade you ll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home movies of the bars and discos we haunted if you weren t there this film will undoubtedly seem dull it should have been so much more but sadly it s not two stars for jogging my memory i still miss going to the anvil 
this movie should be retitled sex in the s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea this movie does little to talk about sex in the s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film don t get me wrong the time period looks like a blast and it s rather important to document the scene to which the film refers but as far as calling this film sex in the s the title is a bit misleading technically it s no oscar nominee but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject overall an eh 
i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive unenlightening little film it is a minutes film that felt like minutes and has about minutes of modestly engaging material it s not bad in any offensive way it just repeats things that have been said many many times over and more interestingly and provocatively with only a couple of exceptions the interviews drone on and on and on making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic it s more like a how to guide for something that can t be done anymore i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented 
formulaic to the max neither title reflects the serial s actual content fighting nazis in morocco actually the iverson ranch the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights the packaging claims over fistic encounters in chapters that s at least three a chapter aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman watching how much furniture is overturned smashed thrown burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about when the protagonists start fighting you can bet that everything in the room will be in it too so kudos to the fight choreographer who is the real star of this serial two positive notes the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights and best of all we have the girl side kick often a journalist as she is here actually participating in the mayhem mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in manhunt of mystery island on the negative side there are just too many jump out of the way escapes before the slab falls before the car goes over the cliff before the speedboat explodes before the building explodes before the truck hits you etc etc it is claimed that this serial partially inspired george lucas to make the first indiana jones film but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial s development rod cameron shines as a moving rock a role he played in all his films other than watching all the furniture getting smashed there s nothing really going on here compared to other serials that have fewer fights more story better actors and more developed characters i give it a for all the furniture smashing 
i have to differ from the other comments posted amid sporadic funny moments there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny the strain shows i watched this with two friends on another friend s recommendation none of us were thrilled 
is the cannes controversy meter remarkably esoteric or is that we americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore be that as it may with plenty of careful analyzing falscher bekenner at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to cannes in a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it s glum american re title low profile building on familiar themes of bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation kind of admittedly it s a film not without it s surface level interests it starts out with a grabber as a haunting shot of a desolate off the highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter who ultimately walks by a totaled car where supposedly a brutal hit and run has left the driver dead in a gory mess stunned he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine just out of school the drifter turns out to be armin steebe a product of the german suburbs with minimal ambition persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it every one with the same fruitless outcome getting mighty sick of it his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown as the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he s doing nothing out of the ordinary if you seem confused about what exactly is going on don t worry about being the only one this is about as far and coherent as the story gets the plot seems simple enough and perhaps due to it s seemingly direct purposes that s why falscher bekenner becomes pointlessly convoluted becoming enamored with endless false conclusions dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument supposedly the soul numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland or something about youth s fascination with crime hey it could even be a coming out movie at hand it spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols both tangible and surrealistically allegorical but they don t seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest the most fatal flaw however is how the filmmakers paint all it s characters in a rough shade of vanilla there s hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose and how the secondary characters especially the confused relationship between armin and his rather normal perhaps too normal family catalyze the already under developed lead character s plight never comes into focus how are we supposed to identify with this young almost adult s rebellion with little sense of the world he s living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it many people drop in and out of the movie including armin s sort of girlfriend katja and a strange affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever they ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next and even a movie that supposedly toys with reality especially with armin s nightly exploits it ends with a literal almost moralizing head scratcher that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put it s viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion without any color it s impossible to shade anything vital in 
a by the numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non allegiance and usage of the term blackwater the cinematography appears right out of basic cable mow land which removes any semblance of swampy murky atmosphere from the proceedings in addition there s not nearly enough gore sex or attractive young things to satiate the majority of the film s targeted viewers that being said the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive skinned presence what else needs to be said about this non winner don t rent unless you ve got a thing for middle aged adults bemoaning their past and rants with clich d priests shrinks hispanic stablemen all regretting their past actions 
unless you re interested in seeing hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters lots of histrionics and cheap s gore not much of it either i would advise to avoid this movie it is long winded overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it masterpiece no an average thriller shot in an average fashion in a gorgeous italian landscape i m a huge fan of slow paced movies when there is a plot to delight and entertain you in this case it didn t work out for me the plot is trite interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical italian widow dressed all in black sobbing if you are not acquainted and familiar with the italy country side the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking this movie isn t however nothing out of the ordinary there are much better italian horror flicks than this not much else than a yawn fest 
while this movie did have a few scary moments great use of music and film angles to build suspense it s obvious director ethan wiley and scriptwriter ellary eddy didn t waste any time researching their subject matter which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine catholic bishop amongst the many inconsistencies jacob the roman catholic priest when we first meet him outside the church is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb chasuble or surplice academic robes are commonly worn by protestant ministers in liturgical denominations not roman catholic priests jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons he attributes it to st paul this verse is not from st paul s writings neither is it in the bible i can t even find it in the gnostic scriptures jacob tells his bishop he doesn t believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete later that same day within minutes of talking to possessed isabelle sure it s possible but a little unrealistic see father damien as a priest psychologist in the original the exorcist for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skeptic turned believer miguel the former priest turned farmhand is the first to try an exorcism on isabelle he quotes scripture and she quotes back he says i see you know psalm she corrects him that s psalm they re both wrong miguel the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism making the sign of the cross calling on the name of christ applying holy water etc tells jacob he doesn t believe in church and he doesn t believe in god maybe he s just conflicted jacob enlists him to put on home made vestments and have another go at it anyway miguel the former roman catholic priest crosses himself backwards or eastern orthodox style as an hispanic roman catholic who used to be a priest he should ve crossed himself forehead to sternum left side to right side of chest i had to read into the little side stories to get the notion satan was messing with the whole family not just isabelle but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery except for the sheriff it s pretty clear he was guilty on the positive side isabelle was creepy in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and i liked the plot twist with claire i m just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof listening to the running commentary with cameron daddo and ethan wiley i m inclined to believe it was a joke 
blackwater valley exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl do i need to describe any more of the plot to you the exorcist and the exorcism of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies classics imo blackwater valley exorcism bve is not not by a long shot it s certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been from start to finish it has the feel of a made for sci fi channel production it s one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on mystery science theater or a similar show the make up and effects were absolutely laughable the acting was horrendously bad there was not a single performance that didn t lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling oh except maybe for jeffery re animator combs as the sheriff the script wasn t that terrible but it certainly wasn t anything special it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room oh there was something i learned from this movie apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room c mon and if your daughter is possessed don t worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices eat rabbits try to stare you down and put fog machines in their bed other than that there is nothing to worry about apparently she was possessed with a low budget d list demon there was none of the ghastly deeds done by a list demons like crucifix intercourse painful body distortions or even projectile vomiting totally laughable movie not worth even a discount rental out of 
this movie just seemed to lack direction the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering the exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character s back stories which were a little weak to begin with all in all i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven t seen before you re much better off just watching the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose 
let me tell you something this movie exceeds all of the troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it actually tries to come across as a serious movie from the terrible acting i knew it i knew she was possessed to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers this piece of dung takes the cake i am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad this may just be in a class all its own the kicker is that supposedly some cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation i did not know that people from backwoods usa act like utter imbeciles i am not sure if i am upset for renting it or have stumbled across a jewel of comedy this was a very guilty pleasure so awful that i watched with hands over my eyes half the time while i wasn t laughing so hard i was crying the ending simply made no sense whatsoever pulling the whole thing together perfectly if you want to watch something so awful its funny here is your movie if you want a scary movie on exorcism move on 
while watching blackwater valley exorcism i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughter there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself if you dare the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn t and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort even the priest and i haven t even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelle s father the director must have just told him to act like he s got a stick up his because that s the general impression one gets i don t really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be had for all the wrong reasons but if you re looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary well run don t walk 
as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them from the opening sentences you quickly gather that the actors are talentless the script editor was probably dead and the director should be to be honest i didn t manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach i have never and i mean never seen a film as sweaty as this one and i watch tons of crap films turd 
blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle kristin erickson is found wandering around covered in dog s blood her parents ely randy colton blanche leslie fleming mitchell own the ranch are deeply worried about their daughter recently she has not been herself is considered a danger to herself other s ranch hand ex priest miguel del zamora recognises isabelle s symptoms as a possible case of possession when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it blanche calls priest jacob cameron daddo who is her other daughter claire s madison taylor ex husband to see isabelle he confirms miguel s suspicions accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle an innocent girl free directed by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism i kept asking the same question over over again why do i do it why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder right lets honest about this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total utter unashamed rip off of the exorcist you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share there s the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny suggest inappropriate things the demon that uses past misdemeanour s against other s the worried parents the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor s the priest with a troubled past the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different other than it s total crap is that it tries to give all the character s some screen time tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it s so badly written acted it just ends up being boring the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either the rest of the character s are poorly written fleshed out at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof there s a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers after he states that she needs a little prick he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof serious horror drama or it did in my opinion at least according to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on actual events yeah right actual events from that happened in a film called the exorcist this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest there isn t even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up there s a scene of a cut arm there s a dead dog someone is stabbed with a crucifix that s about it there s surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast s are seen one pair of naked female breast s is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it there is zero scares no atmosphere a really amateurish feel to the whole film too with a supposed budget of about i must say that i am wondering where all the money went the film looks ugly cheap throughout there are no special effects to speak of the production values are rock bottom the acting is very poor from all involved genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache a terrible accent he is better than this blackwater valley exorcism is a complete rip off of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic the makers are thirty five years too late anyway a total turkey from start to finish 
this movie had very few moments of real drama after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn t quite take us to hell and back viewing was pure purgatory to say the least the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn t stop laughing the continuity between some of the scenes was dire characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else surely this was a spoof of the exorcist the collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day mr russo signed up for this one do i speak latin et tu brutus 
i have to agree with the previous reviewer although the kristin erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl i seriously don t think that isabelle the character she was playing was possessed i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not i also had to watch some parts of it over again to make it clear as to what the letter said what the characters names were and i m still not clear on a few things that happened whether they were real or not i m trying to find the original story that it was based on to compare facts but i can t seem to find anything about it online it wasn t a bad movie but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy special effects wise the movie wasn t bad for a grade b pretty much and those possession scenes made it all worth while that is if you have nothing better to do lol
even worse then the incredibly boring the exorcism of emily rose it started off decently and right up until the mom said to the dad see i knew she was possessed in an i told you so voice it was a terrible line spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie every family member has an issue from the past with the priest the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her culminating with him killing his buddy then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn t slept with his wife after all people are dying others are coming under possession and by this point most viewers don t even care anymore except for their employee miguel none of the characters in this movie was actually likable making it hard to care about any of them the acting was terrible and the writing even worse glad i saw it for free although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost 
the plot seemed to be interesting but this film is a great dissapointment bad actors a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur if there was c movies this would be a perfect example a plus for a nice dvd cover though and a great looking female actor 
ok i normally don t add comments on movies but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife beating pederast priest and this podunk family of horse freaks and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism the wife beating pederast priest manage to save the day but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie sh t i ve ever seen any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn 
a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon the local priest who formerly dated isobel s sister must try to save her but the bigger problems are with the family s suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter this film is directed by ethan wiley the writer of house and the writer director of house ii i loved the first film and liked the second one even better so you would think this would be a winner alas this one looks like it was thrown together by first year film students dawson leery could have done better i have thought about blaming new writer ellary eddy especially because the idea is hardly original are they trying to cash in on the fans of the exorcism of emily rose but wiley should have been able to do his magic also you d like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film russo playing the bishop barely shows up and combs has a great role as a sheriff for the five minutes he s on screen but i love the mustache so no help here after seeing the exorcist all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default no and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least no head spinning or paranormal activity at all just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup all the demonic stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife as another reviewer wrote you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it s a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it s chuck e cheese gone wild that sadly sums up the extent of the evil in this movie if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off camera this is the movie for you but if you don t mind my saying so you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you re seeking the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife who didn t but did sleep with his daughter and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife who might have but denies it and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god what was all the bible quoting you were doing five minutes ago a horrible exorcism movie horribler examples of what combs and russo are capable of and such a sad display of directing after the house series of films became classic i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal uninspired film the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin 
this movie was probably one of the worst movies i ve seen in a very long time a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store and all but forced me to watch it an action we both deeply regret ehh where to start the writing the acting the quality all of it sucked quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies blatant dialog such as how ya doing not that great doc directly after an attempted exorcism of a man s daughter and then his wife s attempted suicide of course he s not that great was at some points kind of funny if not horribly written planned out and obvious the general plot of the movie the writing and the way it worked horrible it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could the only almost good sex scene between the preacher and the tattooed peirced girl was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film oh yeah and they never actually got the deed done the acting horrible x i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel del zamora and his part was written horribly the worst acting arguably paul kappellas whose acting combined with shitty music a gun and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through he even screwed up his own death scene one that should have been easy to nail although most everybody else s acting was horrible as well the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died that same amount of people became possessed at one point and then the remaining characters couldn t be counted on one hand like thumbs down p s what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable anyways 
i m not sure if this is a comedy or not but i found it pretty comical isobel is possessed by the devil somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna fix that part exorcism and part soap opera you ll at least get some laughs there s the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister valley of the dolls mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode but i actually paid to see this instead of the cool head twisting sailor cursing and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it s a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it s chuck e cheese gone wild so if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending this is your movie 
the movie started very well so far isabelle s exorcism could be believed but later gosh i didn t know if it was a horror movie a drama one or a must not see one the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie the make up well it looked pretty real at beginning but at the end last part of movie the make up especially teeth and eyes was very exaggerated if you want a good exorcism movie watch the exorcism of emily rose together with hard candy totally boring pathetic plot and ending these two movies are the worst i ve seen from lionsgate but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films but with this one you will wish you never rent it exorcism movie fans just stay with two the exorcist and emily rose s exorcism 
i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying and i don t normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd but this looked so interesting and scary i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose both terrific movies that made break throughs not only horror wise but story as well blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl isabelle who from the get go is automatically possessed so we can t even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener i know i know then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabella s sister and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle i m not sure then we get into a story with isabelle s dad and his questioning of his wife s faithfulness to him i mean the story just goes into too many directions and wasn t well developed at all not to mention that the exorcism didn t seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film which i didn t like at all because i couldn t take it seriously whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well so i wouldn t really recommend this 
documentaries about fans are always mishmashes and never worth seeing through but i found this one made by some of the fans themselves more than usually unenlightening as a veteran of the original tolkien craze forty years ago i d hoped for more than the obvious which doesn t always equate to the true if there s anyone living who doesn t already know the nature of a fandom any fandom from having been or known a fan he won t discover it here between irrelevancies platitudes to which the actors from the films are particularly prone and acting out by fans making the most if not the best of their one shot at fame i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr the special emotional responses it evokes and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take in addition the film is rather lazy it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort e g what the exact legal loophole was the wording of a copyright notice that permitted the books unauthorized publication in the u s speaking of which i take strong exception to the film s dismissal of the covers on that edition as irrelevant and psychedelic which they were not they were the work of jack gaughan a very able sf illustrator of the period and some fans including me found them more apt and more attractive than the covers on the rival set 
dante would of been mortified if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing no one really will care who the puppet was people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief by this dumb little movie this should be a crime and i cant believe you would ruin a book like that i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it your just making it a big joke 
this demented left wing wipe out trivializes dante s great work distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition inserts hateful ideology incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place and itself deserves a place in the eighth circle tenth bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers sandow birk has reserved himself a spot next to it stocking hell with republican political figures fox news helicopters and christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege to say nothing of extreme liberal bias it is however unoriginal tedious and trite nothing in birk s unworthy and heretical revision is in the least relevant to the original text or is in any way entertaining humorous or enlightening despite his smug pretension to the contrary i could have eaten a reel of video tape and puked a better movie i regret the two hours of my life that i lost watching this insult to the very concept of poetry calliope will weep forever 
i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn t involved with this movie an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell mao zedong and karl marx didn t make an appearance in hell but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler perhaps we ll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures cheap shots at religion right wing politicians corporations and their lobbyists fox news even suvs all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the other side of the aisle to not have been a conscious effort the singular exception i noticed in the hour and a half is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non partisan 
made it through the first half an hour and deserved a medal for getting that far lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time what sounded like a good idea for a movie was badly executed 
too bad this movie isn t while nemesis game is mildly entertaining i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie especially the situations that sara was putting herself into are we supposed to believe that this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun but don t put the whole i never sinned riddle together until the very end and then and then get this she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together i know it was the filmmaker s device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think we re that stupid when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde there is not one topless chick in the whole building nada c mon i know it s canada but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweed and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that riddlezone site that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow and didn t turn into a little hand like all cursors do when you click on a hyperlink i mean if you re gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie at least get the little things right geez 
a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dante s inferno there is nothing especially clever dante s divine comedy was a brilliant piece of social commentary this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and or religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door it s really a shame that the entire film couldn t have been a musical that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun 
kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times he may have made more classics than anyone else he may have been a perfectionist but man was his first attempt ever bad kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map it looks like an ed wood film it has strange narration cheap shots bad dialogue ominous music reminiscent of your s sci fi horror flick and what looks like relatives of the cast of reefer madness going insane for no reason sure you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there it is a psychological horror study of war the characters became dehumanized and insane there are people playing more than one role there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people and there are a few interesting shots around there but really this is a mess of course i am not discouraging you from watching it if you get a hold of it you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it 
fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still to come greatness kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video he considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his evaluation this is a weak and tedious film at minutes it still seems longer than barry lyndon it nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments it s a difficult film to find only unofficial copies are in circulation though perhaps this may change if kubrick s estate relents and has it released on video recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts 
stanley kubrick a director who i hold in the highest of esteems for his masterpieces clockwork orange the killing the shining dr strangelove etc took the film out of circulation leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and completists after seeing the film for myself i could see why at the age of kubrick had already honed his craft of still photography for look magazine and had done a few short documentaries like many first time filmmakers that came in the decades after him his ambition for fear and desire was in short to just go and make a film cheaply more than likely to see if he could do it on that level he was successful however the film itself definitely is not i can t really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout even as the film s story went on the wayside and the actors whom kubrick didn t have any idea how to direct not being a man of the theater his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its seeds in this film at times there are some shots of close ups and quick shots in suspense action scenes that are eye catching unfortunately this is all the good i can really say of the film although there are a couple of name actors in the film frank slivera who also appeared in killer s kiss and paul mazursky a director in his own right the performances overall are dull and very routine in fact that is the film s main demise for me whenever i watch any kubrick film even his early film noirs killer s kiss and the killing i can tell who made it as his style by then became distinct which would continue as he evolved as an artist it wasn t artsy like i might have pictured which is usually the case with first time directors like scorsese and spielberg but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn t kubrick it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b or even c grade movie by a director that time forgot not quite ed wood bad but close the music is as standard as can be the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention in short as others have said and which i can agree this is a doodle pad of a future ground breaker who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage but not enough to really recommend except to those like myself who end up seeing everything by kubrick or perhaps have to see every ultra low budget war film ever made if only out of curiosity 
this sickly sweet and laboriously paced reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd s better films gags are sparse and mostly uninspired saccharine melodrama is abundant the setup takes forever as lloyd the unconventional but impossibly kindly country doctor makes his rounds bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children the elderly and puppies it s like a version of patch adams ugh 
it s another variation on the oft told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris from television and it shows because it s the kind of tale that plays like a half hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length but with a scarcity of laughs or to put it differently only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half hour limits of a tv show doris day decided to call it quits after this film and it s rather easy to see why even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn t help brian keith barbara hershey pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen nothing much can be said in favor of it skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films 
and obviously i didn t see it but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they re not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one won t you say and i can t believe that someone like louis gossett jr would return for something like that did jason gedrick really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film i ll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd 
louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters played by jason cadieux who is in for jason gedrick who wisely declined to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry this one however doesn t have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation game played by two lobotomized teenagers it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here and i saw cover up firewalker aces iron eagle iii toy soldiers and jaws d what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he s working as i look at his post oscar win some of his better movies include iron eagle the punisher and the principal considering that the latter two movies have him co starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work of course enemy mine and diggstown remain his best post oscar win work out of bad 
whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot in this case once was enough iron eagle was a good movie to watch even though it is unrealistic it is still entertaining iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia i didn t even bother to watch iron eagle iii but from looking at the r rating i assume it s more violent than the past movies well iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel lou gossett jr returns as the always delightful chappy sinclair another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters canadian jason cadieux who looks just like jason gedrick from the first iron eagle but wait here comes a possible spoiler wasn t doug killed in iron eagle ii the writers must ve been desprate for a story so they revived doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians this movie was the cheapest done of all the iron eagle films why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies ex police academy movies i have always liked gossett jr s work in these films he was the only one holding this turkey together let s hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels let it rest in peace 
this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and like an h g welles story i can t quite recall may live to want back keep in mind that this is a short very short it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring bang it s over and believe me the punch line is one you will remember i m not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase or available on the web but either way you d be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy of that i am sure 
where do i begin its one of the most frustrating movies i ve seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid a movie about a ghost inhabited bed the first minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a fabienne from pulp fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie this is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everything s normal then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame this is where things get fishy why didn t they bring or buy a g d damn bed frame before they got there we learn that the door leading to the attic where the first minutes took place doesn t open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens they go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved or so they thought the rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe the female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they re bring tortured or tied up one of which has gray hair and appears over years old yuck the female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie they find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge while packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her well if you ve read this far you have to be thinking one thing why the hell didn t they just throw the bedframe out the window seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bed so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on that s why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than sonny corleone at a toll booth the couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every minutes why didn t they just throw the bed out especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something all in all its a near watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple you re scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be the highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can t shoot her like that out of a low budget porno the man show would love 
are you kidding me the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog and the music was nothing great anyone know what jake s mother said when he walked in the door and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn t know what to do with dramatic dialog and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho couldn t we have had a better line here was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over mixed way to loud music 
a family a teenage boy his mother and a stepdad sick of city life decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start however their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father who don t take kindly to newcomers on their patch while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio s sister with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly the lad decides to take matters into his own hands veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made at first you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters especially the overwrought bad guys but then you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch or the thug s sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero in fact the whole view of women in the movie which seems to be that they re pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can t defend themselves is pretty despicable but of course there s the obligatory nude scene which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra less under a very thin t shirt who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs right the climax centres on the teenager who up until now hasn t been able to sneeze without jumping suddenly morphing into a rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang it s completely implausible but hey so is everything else in this film so at least you can t accuse it of not being consistent so rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn t exist check out the imdb pages for janet laine green dehl berti stephen hunter jonathan crombie etc notice a pattern emerging here their careers all hit dead ends why sit through this and all will become clear remember kids if you want to get ahead in this business hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you please 
olivia d abo in a wet t shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it other than that this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody s time the writing is bad the acting is poor and the direction is sub standard 
lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers both boys around living at home with absolutely nothing going for them i live in the midwest and i can t name one family like this i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor now i realize i need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work the acting and camera work and editing was fine the first minutes got you set and the last minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end and we watched the entire movie the male family members as expected simply walked out after the first minutes 
i was attracted to this film by its offbeat low key real life story line that is a twenty something guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother it just might have worked but there s a problem and that problem s name is casey affleck casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film his acting mantra must be exert as little effort as possible at all times or why speak when you can mutter or maybe put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls lips moving when speaking barely facial expressions none muscles in face atrophied something nothing anything zip 
the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i ve seen a duff film i guess i m looking to find reassurance that it s not just me for me then lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop out hackneyed conclusion so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim out on a limb alienated as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation since after a while the gushing dies down and i m relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own i feel vindicated it is a rubbish film it doesn t hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it praise be to kindred spirits 
whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film making it s thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever if you re depressed already this film will send you over the edge if you re feeling somewhat depressed this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about you ll feel that it s just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed i didn t btw safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim s then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you d previously realized you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish the sad truth is much as i wanted to like this movie i hated it it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly for no reason whatsoever looked back at itself and then stopped jim does not have an epiphany at least not one that is conveyed on screen jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self discovery of course no one alive could write a happy ending to this movie as others have said it s no hollywood tale it s gritty and it s real it s well made life is quite a struggle at times if anyone were to know the answer they do well to shout it from the rooftops still i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say you feel that it s going to say something that if you just suffer through a little more of it it ll have something to say it ll make you stop and think it doesn t again i do submit that this is a well crafted film and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e g lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes for the rest of us it s utterly miss able 
i like steve buscemi i like his work very much both as an actor and a director you could say that i am into steve buscemi a steve buscemi freak i lurv steve buscemi i remember when i first saw buscemi s full length directorial debut trees lounge i enjoyed the movie although it wasn t as good as it could have been it was almost there it almost scratched that itch the itch of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns it was close enough to where i would say that it was a very good movie one that with a few tweaks could have been great but that s ok i like the movie and i ve watched it more than once but this review is not about trees lounge it s about lonesome jim when i saw the description of the movie and then i saw who s movie it was i was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that i knew that trees lounge could have been but what i actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation in other words this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that i wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning or if you happen to be the floozy waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile the film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich with store brand white bread no less and the emotion of a cadaver i am not sure what the point of this film was and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission sorta like those new cars that don t come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars i m not one of them but hey i can sympathize overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film i mean trees lounge was about boring people doing boring things but it was interesting i blame a lot of this on affleck why do people keep casting these affleck turds they suck the life out of anything that they are connected with one affleck was in one decent film and wasn t even the reason why the film was decent and all of the sudden every butthole named affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can and liv tyler is no better being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress she is as lifeless as affleck these people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script people pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma these two duds together don t have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at wal mart i always thought that steve buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum but oh steve you let us down this film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper 
i am sitting here writing this review and the movie s not even over yet in fact i just checked and there are more minutes to go but no matter there s no need to see it through to the end i ll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which i don t care to ever see or know what accounts for my hostility to this movie the characters are not believable the plot is not believable the pretentiousness of the movie is sickening basically every element of the movie rings false buscemi obviously thought he had something to add to the dozens of movies which have already explored the well worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent meaninglessness of life however buscemi was badly mistaken because this movie contains nothing new it tries very hard to be depressing but fortunately no one can really be depressed by it because it s obvious that no people like this exist in the entire world what is depressing however is the knowledge that somehow this film was voted several undeserved awards disgusting bottom line stay away from this worthless film at all costs 
 yesterday as a movie is hard to rate the cinematography is excellent and deserves a the story is gritty and real and does not compromise but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work as a person who was born and raised in central africa i appreciated the authenticity of the film s look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of yesterday unlike the film the gods must be crazy which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology yesterday has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind and i doubt it was intended for the western mind the scenes are long and slow the editing is not paced for a mph instant gratification world the dialog is not cleaver or witty it is real movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment it is education this movie is best viewed by those who know appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub sarah africa if you lack a broad enough world view to understand other cultures especially african cultures should skip this film do not waste you time with it go see talladega nights or larry the cable guy instead for your cross culture viewing i give it a for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world i would give it a 
i mistakenly thought this was the s art film about the bed that eats people which sounded interesting it isn t interesting i mean let alone about a man eating bed i assume stuart gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that lloyd kaufman puts troma on just about anything that s been shot with a video camera in the interest of building up a franchise library little more can be said about this opus other than the running time is less than minutes it is of course about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes along the way we get a five minute opening credit sequence is the one for lawrence of arabia even as long a murderer with marylin manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in cat s eye demonstrations of a sexual practice michael hutchence may have employed a preview of what emilio estevez will soon look and act like soft core porn even cinemax would pass on manbutt and one topless scene a wacky or is it whack ee ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie well it looked that way to me and a rudimentary surprise ending apros pos of nothing much it s like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the deathbed before finishing the last draft it s not scary it s not sexy it s shot on hi def video and doesn t look bad but doesn t look good either the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else no one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie the modern day double feature i wasn t paying attention for parts of it so i may have missed something but for some reason i doubt it rating pass
i m pretty sure poe would have considered this a travesty the first two stories are decent nothing spectacular and then there s toby dammit what on earth was fellini thinking it s a rambling random dull piece with little to recommend it one should feel frustrated at the lack of backstory or conclusion but there s only relief that it s over 
what is it about the french first they apparently like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does second they seem to like edgar allan poe s work more than just about anyone else does it s got to be the beaudelaire effect don t get me wrong i m a poe fan myself but this trilogy manages to make three of poe s below average stories into well i m not sure what they re made into toby dammit is a fine fellini film but it has nothing to do with poe s story at least in terms of theme it s enjoyable on the first viewing terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role however it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead metzergenstein is a big mess how did vadim s films get produced it s just awful not even up to amateur film school standards depending on the dvd menu you have try to skip it and save your time william wilson is actually the segment that is most faithful to poe s work it does not have much style though even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film it looks like the boys are throwing tissues or maybe handkerchiefs that have been rolled up into balls my advice is to skip metzergenstein watch william wilson and then if you re a fellini fan i m not keep toby dammit on while you cook dinner or make a snack 
it s reassuring to see that other imdb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film at the risk of blaspheming against the great vadim malle and fellini these directors may be talented artistic in their own right however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and s chic as in any way related to edgar allen poe s stories they exposed themselves as frauds either a they didn t bother to read the poe stories or b they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn t pay poe any mind imagine if metallica plugged in their guitars cranked the amps up to and moshed out chords claiming it to be beethoven s th symphony that s the feeling you ll get after sitting through this film if you re a vadim malle fellini fan metallica you ll dig it if you re a beethoven fan poe you ll puke metzergenstein here we begin with a bizarre porno version of poe ok porno may be a bit extreme haha but at the very least you have to call it a barbarella version including i don t doubt some of jane s outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp vadim falls into old clich s of his own the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow cam we see the apathy in her eyes the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism cute stuff but metzergenstein ain t the place for it and in addition to the barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes jane fonda s awful american accent and unconvincing performance as a european countess made this the worst casting since julia roberts in that lousy version of dr jekyll mr hyde william wilson here s a great poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world if you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme go watch star trek episode the alternative factor but here malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on any guesses yup eroticism sadism and debauchery ho hum brigitte bardot s role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end and once again the director distorts a classic poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues do it on your own time malle i thought we re here on poe s dime toby dammit the absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film i ve seen since staying alive at least fellini showed some tact in changing the title but his departure from the original plot theme and humour of the story is so vast i wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies stamped edgar allen poe story on it and submitted it to this collection i strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with poe s works but there was absolutely none the original poe story never bet the devil your head is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims i ll bet the devil my head on a foggy morning the devil takes him up on his offer the result is the sickest and silliest thing you ve ever read this was poe the comedian at his finest yes poe wrote many comedies also check out a predicament and devil in the belfry if you want a taste of his witty satirical works this fellini version it s bland soulless and not funny at all unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for minutes here fellini s egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy pretense and mediocrity of cinema most of it is set at an awards ceremony where fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm cynicism and that classic sour grapes attitude that we find in all fellini films dealing with cinema note the sarcastic jabs at the critics a recurring theme in fellini s films for someone who considered himself above the critics fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them at any rate i feel like fellini just took some outtakes from spliced them together and sold it as a poe story worst adaptation ever i think i put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a poe movie 
i saw this film in the movie theater i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense it is a woodward film about one of second city s native sons everyone knew about johns history everyone knew how he died some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy but hey the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect this movie well forget the idea of poor michael chilklis who is a really great actor being in a really astonishingly bad film and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of belushi s work and all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob woodwards work kinda saying okay we are about to mess with belushi now lets go after woodward too they also decided to take the premise of it s a wonderful life and turn it into it s a horrible life on crack is he a guardian angel or the devil is the pinball machine the devil s assistant electronic device how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie it is one of those movies after it is over you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go what the hell was that in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic but for good reason a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of or throw out snappy one liners to the screen a cult film is never good and most people would never watch them in any serious context if you want to watch some classic bad late s fair stoned rent wired if you want to know about john belushi you can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie 
this could have been a good biopic but what a mess i had this film when i was a theater manager when i put the film together and watched it i thought i had some reels out of order as it turned out i didn t and if i did nobody would have noticed i couldn t figure out what s going on everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way 
 wired would have to rate as one of the ten worst films i have ever seen the writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and i m sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film it fails to work either as a tribute to belushi s unique talent or as an accurate account of his short life a pointless mess with no redeeming features 
this movie narrate the story of john belushi based of his biography `wired wrote by bob woodward all of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order where after the death of john belushi we see one angel accompany belushi during few points of his life michael chicklis in the character of john belushi is enough credible but entirely devoid of the devastate force of belushi and his play stay only a pale animation the director on more not succeed to give continuate on the story that for who not knows the book is very confused but the worse is that they have featured bob woodward that spoke with belushi before he died for this negative points the movie is only a would be attempt to narrate the controversial story of john belushi my rate is 
and i have seen a lot of films i saw this in the theatre in and to this day i remember the sickening urge to walk out if you like john belushi respect his talent or even the sanctity of the cinema this film has nothing to offer you it is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of belushi s biography bob woodward as we see the progression of belushi s life pass on the screen woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character the most offensive scene occurs when belushi is dying looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters breathe for me woodward there are too many terrible things to mention them all the least of which is the opening that has belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named angel i ll leave it at that 
journalist bob woodward s blistering scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi s rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie a nebulous fantasy directed by larry peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital michael chiklis years before his breakthrough on the shield is put in the unenviable position of portraying belushi taking a post mortem trip through his life recreating those saturday night live skits which are now part of tv history it s like watching someone try to out lucy lucille ball it can t be done the reason why there was such sorrow at belushi s death was because he was one of a kind chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part and he s funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue still it s an uphill venture and no actor no matter how talented could have saved it from 
any film school student could made a film times better than piece of garbage as someone who had read the book i expected even a straight re telling of the book would make this a fair film there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond woodward s narrative and make a great film well the director did go beyond woodward s narrative he added a hip hispanic angel named velasquez that was not in the book he had bob woodward interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the morgue the film had all the insight of someone stoned on pcp staring at his navel if this is a spoiler to you you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made 
rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title and realizing that i had rented it some time before quick plot line a couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe estevez still cursing the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act they find a bed in a forgotten room but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the s and his last victim their ghosts inhabit the couple first enhancing their sex life but eventually becoming more menacing what ensues is cheap r rated sex scenes cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time 
after seeing the dvd release of the blues brothers and their mention of wired on belushi s bio my boyfriend and i were hungry for more information on john belushi i had heard of wired but didn t know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store i understand that dan akroyd was really p ed over this movie and i thought it was because it didn t portray them in a good light but that had nothing to do with it the movie starts out okay until they wheel in john s body to the morgue when he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run for it then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie john is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with angel a puerto rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over the two actors who portray john and dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors let alone anyone else related for that matter i e lorne michaels making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life but that is the tip of the iceberg i believe this was supposed to be an artsy film john constantly being tormented by drugs i e the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine in such a way that was also difficult to follow the flashbacks are choppy also making it difficult to understand probably the most tasteless scene was when john is literally forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use obesity yeah we get the point without the grotesque portrayal there are very few other actors we know of in the movie where s carrie fisher for instance they were incredibly close and jim belushi would have been a great person to show it looks very cheaply made we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early s or late s it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all didn t show the side to john at all i felt i knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of saturday night live on one last note bob woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie arguing with john about writing his life story for someone who was supposed to be very highbrow concerning the bust on nixon his calibur of person could match any writer in the national enquirer and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward skip this movie if you want to see more on john watch his movies see clips of dan akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on john that goes along the lines of man on the moon which is ultimately what we were expecting i guess this was a moral kind of movie you know don t do drugs but i guess the creators of this film didn t understand that his death made a number of people like carrie fisher stop doing drugs altogether for that reason 
plodding maybe that should have been the title bad dialogue delivered at a snail s pace all the characters are single dimension with the exception of one unfortunately that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this clich ridden two hour drag having grown up in the seventies this film is seriously lacking in detail atmosphere and authenticity surprisingly this was produced by kelsey grammar someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script cameron richardson is about the only element that lights up this film robin trower s music is also a welcomed addition 
i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home definitely not what the dvd cover claims destined to be the next stoner classic hardly wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes there are some really pretty girls in this always nice to see a good looking cast almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on sound design was a bit poor i think less would have been best 
when i think of a s period film this is not what i think of i don t want a monotonous one song robin trower soundtrack i want a soundtrack punctuated with the top bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the s the generic karaoke style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying the acting if you can call it that was very wooden and seemed just read from script in monotone the film quality and camera work was horrid the dialog murky the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent i can t believe people are giving it the high ratings i ve read here basically a forgettable poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past two stars is all i can come up with sorry guys 
i disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance i can t imagine this as even approaching stoner classic that would be like calling singles a grunge film the movie definitely plods along with a murky plot at times i wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it watching this movie reminded me of watching children play acting and making the story up as they go along the characters are wooden the dialog is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected who got killed when what and this is how you act when your friend overdoses complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality as for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene enough it was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background neither moving forward or back i kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order the acting and dialog would improve or something somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie after minutes it never happened 
the acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play the story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened half the scenes are pointless there is not an inkling of character development the score soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about of the scenes i m glad i only rented the movie yet i still feel cheated avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances it seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film this movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there 
the recent dvd release of good humor man labels the film as comedy it s hardly a comedy rather a dull indie film about a group of losers supposedly set in the s there is scant attention paid to period details with overly muted color correction taking its place the monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film perhaps that is the point but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location the bleachers it seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film which is a complete waste of time 
have you ever read a book then seen the movie and wonder how did they screw it up so bad this is one of those the book by huffaker nobody likes a drunken indian was great riotously funny this movie is not it seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we cared about the characters this movie which touches on some real concerns about indians makes you wonder why we haven t seen more comedies about the holocaust or slavery not well done 
similar story line done many times before and this was no improvement minutes into this and you should pretty much be able to turn it off the ending was deja vu all over again the only morals i could see out of this are stupidity criminals do not equal success if he screwed you before he s gonna do it again

karen and her boyfriend jerry move into their new los angeles apartment they discover an old brass bed that karen takes a liking to unfortunately it has a really sinister history involving kinky sex murders deathbed tries to be a creepy supernatural tale but fails miserably the action is slow the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoever even the sex scenes are lame the climax is pretty gory and violent so fans of splatter should be pleased however the first hour of deathbed is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares definitely one to avoid my rating out of and that s being generous watch re animator or castle freak instead 
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is not a shred of historical accuracy in fact reality is reversed just one example morgan preyed on the few ethnic chinese he encountered the acting is over the top the script is a poorly written lie i have never seen worse fake beards hopper arrived in australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero since the script was ten made up on the fly the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is any movie about ned kelly is a lot better than this film 
the recent release of mad dog morgan on troma dvd is disappointing this appears to be a censored print for television viewing some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version mad dog morgan deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut however even as released on dvd the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century australia after having toured the old melbourne gaol with death masks of convicts on display it is mad dog morgan that comes to mind 
now out of all the shark movies i ve seen this one takes the cake the plot of the movie was good but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards antonio sobato jr does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father a megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well the view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles but the effects were a blur and the scenes were a little weak in some places with the mini sub s weapons there that would take out a whole school of sharks there it was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity although it would indeed cost him his life as well like they say revenge has it s price but was it worth it that answer could go on and on and this movie was a major letdown the beginning was fine and at the end it went like the titanic out of stars 
this could have been good but sadly its too inplausible anthony sabato jr has a grudge please i wanted to like it love shark movies someone should have asked my opinion before they wrote this ha ha the shark is cool but the story lacks alot 
this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles the shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing antonio sabato is horrible i mean even worse than normal how does this guy work the directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films i love shark movies and this one just disappoints i ve seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work i d rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story 
a really awful movie about a meters long shark bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete a waist of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost even if u liked jaws which i averagely did don t see it even if you have interests in paleontology don t see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors corny plots during corny tv time do humanity a favor and do not i repeat do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci fi animal thriller still some people gave it a ten ranting don t know if they were serious or not but sincerely expect they weren t 
hey what a great idea to open a film show someone`s home movie drama schools must be full of idiots there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio hey i think i`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it the greatest romance ever seen or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it the greatest sex ever seen oh hold on i`m not married and i`ve never been on honeymoon not to worry i`ll send in a video of someone elses wedding honeymoon mild spoilers you`d think with an opening like that shark hunter could only improve wouldn`t you as shocking as it may seem the home movie is the best directed best written and best acted part of the film alas it`s all downhill from here as the family go to sea in reality a fog shrouded swimming pool in a three foot yacht where mom and dad get eaten by a cgi fin and their son spencer swears revenge against the fin cut forward to the present day and the french are using an underwater research base for oil exploration only thing is and it`s so obvious you can`t fail to notice this it`s not filmed underwater the director hasn`t made any attempt whatsoever to even use the unconvincing technique of shooting the scene through a fish tank the underwater research base is blown up by the shark maybe it`s hired by greenpeace killing everyone inside and spencer now a grown man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of frenchmen what else happens no idea because i decided to watch something else no hard feelings if any of the cast and crew are reading this and i do hope matt codd becomes a big fish in hollywood you think you know about sharks matt you ain`t seen nothing yet
i was enticed into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb the movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah so i rented it bad idea this movie was bad on so many levels that i m glad that i had the option to fast forward the shark itself is ok it s appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a i gave it a the acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable i wasn t expecting much but i was continually surprised by this suckfest antonio sabato jr is some kind of biologist or scientist or something i wasn t really paying attention he goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course by the way all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater first of all if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station what s with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident the shark theory was advanced by antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against antonio and this young college student horrible actress by the way just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble what is with that unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school i find this a little silly the director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background metal crafting is very important when your on a sub i guess anyway i could go on but i ve said too much already bottom line go to your local video store rent this video and then destroy it then send email asking imdb to remove all record of this movie from their site all memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed we can do it if we work together 
at last a film to rival el padrino and darkness falls in terms of sheer and utter dullness this is actually the first film i ve ever given out of for on imdb and with good reason for one the cast is nothing special that s usually not a problem for me except that the only character that s in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l bush s harrington secondly the production values a substandard television sci fi such as stargate has more convincing sets and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the sfx teams are filmed on dry sets with falling particles that aren t very convincing this film is literally drydocked the worst part though is that this film is boring for the first minutes i felt as if we were going round and round in circles it s a prehistoric shark bullsh t no really bullsh t i m not making this up bullsh t there it is now i didn t see anything let me guess yup bullsh t after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so then we re back to the dialog run around dialog is not a bad thing but that s all this film has characters talking that too is not a bad thing except this film isn t very good at it the dialog is often contrived and clich d and is not very interesting to listen to i don t see any point slandering the special effects this film has worse qualities the sets are small and unrealistic the acting is sub par the script oh lord the script is worse than a garbage of sci fi television has to dredge up it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was yet another awful awful addition to the megaloadon there s about four series of films bring on steve alten please 
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who s a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep unfortunately he can t oh yeah and he s haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character s submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents now the shark in this movie is a really fake looking cgi shark basically this is sorta like shark attack except more depressing if you don t get what i mean listen the film s opening credits show home movies of the main character when he was a child with his parents before they got killed and there s really sad and depressing piano music playing in the background you would expect to see a shark or something and you do a brief shadow of the cgi shark floats around every few seconds but that s just it also i don t remember one happy facial expression at all throughout the film s entire runtime a majority of the film takes place in the dark depths of the abyss where the story gets even more dull and all the characters the shark too die in the end i was thinking sabato would manage to kill the shark and manage to save himself and the girl but no they all die and the film ends with the shark all blown up and the submarine with sabato s crushed and burned body in it sinking into the abyss if you re a happy person and you don t enjoy being depressed then avoid this movie if you re the opposite then congratulations you found your movie 
i saw this movie previewed before something else i rented a while back and it looked decent i ve seen some good stuff from full moon video and thought it was worth a shot unfortunately this was not good stuff the story is about a possessed bed a couple moves into a new apartment discovers the bed and odd things start happening odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex and the man discovers kinky sex and the woman draws pictures of kinky sex and the man photographs kinky sex and they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex you d think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good right well no the problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie or at least a thriller and it just doesn t deliver there is little tension no suspense and no fear aside from some troubling dreams and visions there really isn t anything for this couple to be worried about the whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed sure you get a monster fight at the end and some bloodshed but nothing spectacular there s only one murder and one good scare and that s it and the kinky sex don t get your hopes up or anything else for that matter their idea of kinky sex is woman on top fully clothed trying to strangle her mate with a necktie not exactly my idea of a good time
i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine i ll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge 
actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut the gothic horror frailty with this family friendly sports drama about the u s open where a young american caddy rises from his humble background to play against his bristish idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played i m no fan of golf and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man but some how this film was enthralling all the same the film starts with some creative opening credits imagine a disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of hbo s carnivale and rome but lumbers along slowly for its first by the numbers hour once the action moves to the u s open things pick up very well paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes i loved the rain soaked montage of the action on day two of the open that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings there s some compelling character development when the british harry vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players heads under pressure golf a painfully boring sport is brought vividly alive here credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the twentieth century you know how this is going to end not only because it s based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it despite the formulaic nature this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience 
as a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport s history i was pleased with disney s sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century the movie depicted well the psychological battles that harry vardon fought within himself from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society likewise the young ouimet goes through his own class struggles being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing what i loved best however is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of ouimet s parents his father is a working class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class his mother however recognizes her son s talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior finally the golf scenes are well photographed although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament the little liberties taken by disney do not detract from the beauty of the film there s one little disney moment at the pool table otherwise the viewer does not really think disney the ending as in miracle is not some disney creation but one that only human history could have written 
i saw this film in a sneak preview and it is delightful the cinematography is unusually creative the acting is good and the story is fabulous if this movie does not do well it won t be because it doesn t deserve to before this film i didn t realize how charming shia lebouf could be he does a marvelous self contained job as the lead there s something incredibly sweet about him and it makes the movie even better the other actors do a good job as well and the film contains moments of really high suspense more than one might expect from a movie about golf sports movies are a dime a dozen but this one stands out this is one i d recommend to anyone 
bill paxton has taken the true story of the us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds the acting is exemplary throughout stephen dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie 
i saw this film on september st in indianapolis i am one of the judges for the heartland film festival that screens films for their truly moving picture award a truly moving picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life heartland gave that award to this film this is a story of golf in the early part of the th century at that time it was the game of upper class and rich gentlemen and working people could only participate by being caddies at country clubs with this backdrop this based on a true story unfolds with a young working class boy who takes on the golf establishment and the greatest golfer in the world harry vardon and the story is inspirational against all odds francis ouimet played by shia labeouf of holes gets to compete against the greatest golfers of the u s and great britain at the u s open francis is ill prepared and has a child for a caddy the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in but despite these handicaps francis displays courage spirit heroism and humility at this world class event and we learn a lot about the early years of golf for example the use of small wooden clubs the layout of the short holes the manual scoreboard the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing and with no big movie stars the story is somehow more believable this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of miracle and remember the titans fyi there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back years 
maybe i m reading into this too much but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film i mean when a story is told casting the main character as himself i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing documenting etc and that would make it a little biased but his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongsheng s life i think the best view would have been told from hongsheng s family and friends perspectives they saw his transformation and weren t so messed up on drugs that they remember everything as for hongsheng being full of himself the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life metaphorically of course he s obviously still alive as he was cast as himself for his family s happiness huh the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex he lies on the grass coming down from during a high by himself and with his father he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms his head cocked to the side it s fabulous that he s off of drugs now but he s no hero he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle this same device is used in ted demme s blow where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero however quitting zuotian is a film that is recommended mostly for its haunting soundtrack superb acting and landscapes but the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play it makes the viewer feel as if hongsheng s life was merely a play told in many difficult parts 
i felt this film did have many good qualities the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly of course they are playing themselves but definitely unique the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use i found the jia hongsheng story interesting on a down note the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early s even though this was made in so it s really cheesy sometimes the beatles crap etc whatever not a top ten or twenty but if it s on the television check it out 
this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job it s like they re almost living the past over again jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most there s moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job however this movie is not for everyone many people who suffer from depression will understand hongsheng s problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself others might see the movie as boring because it s just so real that its almost like a documentary overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad 
 quitting may be as much about exiting a pre ordained identity as about drug withdrawal as a rural guy coming to beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim but what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director zhang yang and his actors bring to this journey no clich s no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims hongshen jia is in his mid twenties he s a talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved the perfect recipe for his enablers soon he s the cool actor idolized by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most fashionable he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and a scarf his acting means the arts friends and roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input and his self criticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational self doubt self hatred i didn t know how to act i felt like a phony and to readily available drugs to counter them he says i had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity hongshen s disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittent and doggedly his own solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy the abstract is out and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and high rises of beijing the physicality is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to ritan park the long spontaneous walks the drenching sun and rain grassy picnics the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific he drifts in order to arrive all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer s positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in a current circumstance if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he smashes his videos and tv and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist but he s the only viable guide he knows he even imagines himself as john s son yoko ono and adopts his mother mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the park hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of lennon s influence as showing me a new way in the mental institute the life saving apples resistance nourishment reflect lennon s presence as does hongshen s need to re hang his hero s poster in his redecorated room if lennon s influence is spiriting hongshen s father s influence is grounding although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is fegsen s differences from his son that underwrites his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that he s chinese a peasant in a line of peasants a rural theater director and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions it s this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans beatles and passivity in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts i acted before were bullshit life is bullshit and to hongshen s emphatic you are not my father he softly replies why can t a peasant be your father under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to a real not whole self as the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust integrity banishes his black cloud all his edges soften you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap down incurred for refusing medicine back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back to back fence scene with his musician buddy hongshen says of this movie it s a good chance to think about my life and i might add become a new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity 
i loved this movie from beginning to end i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love skateboarding drawing but my friends were always there for me music was like my rehab life support and my drug it changed my life i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say this movie left me speechless to be honest i just saw it on the ifc channel i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the don t do a very good job on translating lines i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess i almost never got to see this amazing movie good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed well earlier than usual lol i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film i give it three thumbs way up this movie blew me away 
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards 
i first saw this movie on ifc which is a great network by the way to see underground films i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn t hold water but it really was a worth while watch the main character is in such rough shape and you hate to see him deny help but no matter what you just can t hate him his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels the atmosphere of the film is also great at times you feel like you can see what he sees feel what he feels in some situations this movie does not leave you wanting to know more or disliking a loophole in the plot there are no loopholes in my opinion i have always been a fan of foreign films especially now with movies being made so poorly in america i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture this movie did all those things to me and more please watch this movie and if you re new to foreign films this is a great start 
i must say every time i see this movie i am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of hongsheng s life but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction it is also true that getting addicted to anything such as drugs alcohol or pornography cannot only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world your family since family is the priority in the asian culture it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him her this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy not for the fun of it but the elements surrounding it superb acting touching story great direction make this movie worth watching what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b movie actor trying to imitate the real person it shows the genuineness of the movie 
my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him spoiler plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real a must see for someone in the mental health profession 
i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival however as it turned out all the more interesting the story of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction is based on actual facts moreover the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again this time for the film which is partly set up as a stage play not only do they all happen to be good actors jia hongsheng s parents are actors in real life as well the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well the film has a heavy feel but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation 
 night of the hunted stars french porn star brigitte lahaie in fact many of the cast members in this slow moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming this film is certainly different than rollin s usual lesbian vampire flicks but it s not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascination lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can t remember who she is or where she came from most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that s treating a number of people with a similar condition anyway she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held on a highway outside of town she meets a young man who stops and picks her up night of the hunted offers plenty of nudity unfortunately the pace is extremely slow the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well developed still night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyable give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollin s works out of and that s being kind 
even if you re a fan of jean rollin s idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory for once there s not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight true to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the director s vision entirely yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity jean claude couty s atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe br jean a k a gary sandeur contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn t resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cash gathering xxx efforts most notably french f ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead playing elisabeth rather well i might add she s picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert vincent gard re driving home at the end of a long work day barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting robert s name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin further credit to brigitte s thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the s because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding when robert leaves for work he s inevitably erased from elisabeth s feeble mind a mysterious doctor comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type and his menacing assistant solange striking porn starlet rachel mhas move in on her during her protector s absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from here we get one of the movie s strongest scenes as she s re introduced to her roommate catherine the late cath rine greiner a k a hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherine s unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup it s also catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker s compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them several rather explicit if not quite hardcore sex scenes make up the movie s mid section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey a k a cyril val jacques gateau and elodie delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of plumey was only present in the film s rarely screened xxx version filles traquees the pivotal part of v ronique a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet in her unforgettable debut who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirelli s la traviata the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplin s modern times as elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each other s outstretched hands 
i was surprised how much i enjoyed this sure it is a bit slow moving in parts but what else would one expect from rollin also there is plenty of nudity nothing wrong with that particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous brigitte lahaie there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead bit more dodgey perhaps but most effective there is also a sci fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end but i wouldn t bother too much with that no here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films there is some similarity here particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller it is a captivating nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations including a stunning railway setting at the end 
i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can t remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in seems somewhat ahead of it s time out of kids 
i have certainly not seen all of jean rollin s films but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests which if you like that sort of thing is not bad but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio mechanical nightmarish stuff except it s in french with subtitles of course a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up while in the background yet another woman lingers wearing nothing as they drive along it s obvious that there is something not right about the woman in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen still though that doesn t prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris his apartment the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this tower block a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower where others of her kind for whom the no memory things seems to be the least of their problems are being held for some reason time and events march by in the movie which involve mostly trying to find what s going on and get out of the building for this woman and she does manage to call robert the guy that picked her up in the first place to come rescue her the revelation as to what s going on comes in the last few moments of the movie which has a rather strange yet touching end to it in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula rollin created in this what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film i like this one a lot check it out out of 
since this cartoon was made in the old days felix talks using cartoon bubbles and the animation style is very crude when compared to today however compared to its contemporaries it s a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well that s because despite its age the cartoon is very creative and funny felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he can t sell any shoes well felix needs money so he can go to hollywood so he tells the guy at the shop he ll get every shoe sold felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store in gratitude the guy gives felix however felix s owner wants to take the money and go alone so felix figures out a way to sneak along once there felix barges into a studio and makes a bit of a nuisance of himself along the way he meets cartoon versions of comics ben turpin and charlie chaplin in the end though through luck felix is discovered and offered a movie contract hurray 
despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war this film isn t too sticky and pink because love is as a rose with thorns that is the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down to earth the music and lyrics of the cabaret chanson esquire songs sung b keira knightley herself drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film from one place to another between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love some people may find it too much a biopic but it s mostly a romantic story even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy london gets visualized from another angle for once the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms pubs and bars the independent women the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film but all in all this is a great romantic story 
felix in hollywood is a great film the version i viewed was very well restored which is sometimes a problem with these silent era animated films it has some of hollywood s most famous stars making cameo animated appearances a must for any silent film or animation enthusiast 
a gem of a cartoon from the silent era it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos will hays pays a visit as boss of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing gum decimating the shoes of the populace a money making idea for felix s near bankrupt shoe salesman boss cannot be described it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem 
this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie chaplin s work that sound and color are not requirements for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the afore mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word balloons just like in the comics given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and figuratively and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended 
felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham sandwich the dramatic guy that tells felix he ll have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies he s in tears felix just looks at him like he s nuts and shrugs his shoulders the old guy tells felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to hollywood felix thinks how does he expect me to get the money in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat if it works well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that s how he gets to hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there we then witness felix s attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this minute cartoon it s amazing how much more you can get in an extra minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes crazy stuff 
while i can t say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons i would think that writing said cartoons file cards and some of the comics would count for something for fans of the old cartoon this is pretty much a continuation of the same except with a few new characters and a more insane cobra commander we still have all the old favorites too but on a personal note one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff when there are tons of other officers around instead the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well the main trick here seems to be the cgi it s overall pretty good if not a little over the top 
errol flynn s roguish charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting but historically bankrupt biopic of the famous and some would say infamous general custer that follows his career from his first day at west point through the civil war and out west to the battle at the little big horn all the while butting heads with rival arthur kennedy and romancing pretty olivia de havilland some might say that flynn who delivers a great flamboyant performance as the general is basically playing himself playing custer a lavish production that should have been in technicolor well directed by raoul walsh they died with their boots on features some truly well staged battle sequences also it s a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse the previous year flynn played jeb stuart opposite ronald reagan s george custer in santa fe trail also with de havilland another action packed warner brothers production designed to make you fail history class 
warner brothers tampered considerably with american history in big trail director raoul walsh s first rate western they died with their boots on a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn this is one of errol flynn s signature roles and one of raoul walsh s greatest epics walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de havilland as flynn s romantic interest for the last time they appeared as a couple in seven previous films this minute black white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences humorous romantic scenes and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war indeed sheridan was a lieutenant at this point in fact the commandant was robert e lee as the earlier flynn film santa fe trail showed another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war warner brothers presented custer as a drinker probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked nevertheless these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film they died with their boots on opens with custer riding into west point military academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an african american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high ranking foreign general the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp arthur kennedy of city for conquest to take charge of him sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus taipe stanley ridges of task force who promptly runs custer out naturally the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl general phil sheridan john litel of the sons of katie elder is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming as it turns out sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled once he enrolls custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore when the american civil war erupts west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer avid as he is to get into the fight custer encounters his future wife elizabeth libby bacon olivia de havilland of santa fe trail and they pledge themselves to each other despite mr bacon gene lockhart of carousel who detests the sight of custer it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custer s friends and our hero reprimanded bacon meanwhile back in washington custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment but major taipe has him cooling his heels custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott sidney greenstreet of the maltese falcon and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custer s characteristics not only does scott see to it that taipe assigns custer to the second cavalry but also custer appropriates taipe s horse to get to his command during the battle of bull run july custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital custer receives a medal rather than a court martial when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg in pennsylvania scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph when a brigadier general cannot be found scott goads taipe into promoting the first available officer a mistake is made and custer is promoted incredulous at first custer embraces the moment and cracks stuart s advance after the war custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds eventually libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan who was in command of the army and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the th cavalry when he takes command custer finds the th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort meanwhile custer has his first run in with crazy horse anthony quinn of the guns of navarone and takes him into custody of course crazy horse escapes becomes custer s adversary and they fight once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians sharp with taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking taipe in a saloon brawl on his way to washington custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath custer sacrifices himself and his men at the little big horn in a slam bang showdown against redskins stagecoach lenser bert glennon captures both the grit and the glory the long shot of the th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular as an added premonition of custer s imminent demise libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the little big horn they died with their boots on benefits from a top notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune gary owen 
if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining it s got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesn t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction i know i know that s hard to do when you consider custer s last stand at the little big horn and it s prominence in the history of post civil war america so i guess there s an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at it there s a lot to take in here though for the picture s two hour plus run time custer s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the major s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble ironically a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custer s first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel i hadn t noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress with that in mind the owl scene was a hoot too as for flynn it s interesting to note that a year earlier he portrayed j e b stuart opposite ronald reagan s depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynn s portrayal here it s more than evident but it doesn t come close to that of richard mulligan s take on the military hero in s little big man let s just say that one was a bit over the top the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one s point of view earlier a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer s character when he stated you take glory with you when it s your time to go 
after working on movies with director mickael curtiz the adventures of robin hood are their best achievement errol flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great raoul walsh this reunion is a happy thing for cinematography the died with their boots on is their first and best film together raoul walsh portrays the general george armstrong custer errol flynn from his debuts at west point to the civil war and finally at the battle of little big horn it s true the film shows a too heroic portrait of custer but that s not important what is important is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters who can forget california joe the great queen s own buttler with his song garryowen the touching mrs custer olivia de havilland the diabolic sharp well played by arthur kennedy an eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso 
i first viewed they died with there boots on about and though it has been many years since this film and its impression remain the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable yet there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well custer ranked in a graduating class of much has been made of custer s final class ranking but of the cadets who entered the military academy with him in half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day june it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accident his squadron would follow him to hell your at attention sargeant reprimands tape if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attach to not only sheridan but hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellan there is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels custers audacity shone through he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers including a rebel captain yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomac this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise robert l bateman armchair general there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officer he was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the means and the information discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lee s plans to split his forces and yet he failed to act for some hours it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg pa his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some rebels with but a force of i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion there is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments though custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe the truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it 
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller s performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards 
i blame birth of a nation myself for commencing the long running tradition of hollywood travesties of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of custer and his th cavalry crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition try custer and his wife s learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory custer s testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all custer s storming into the president s office to beg to return to his post honestly there s plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness and yet and yet it s still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever dehavilland as beguiling as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth here i think we re closer to the legend of the legend but hey it s only a movie and a rollicking wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that 
being warner brothers second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn general george armstrong custer they died with their boots on warner brothers was the far more accurate of the two especially when contrasted with santa fe trail warner brothers which really didn t set the bar very high although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn there was a change in the casting the part of general custer whereas it was dutch himself ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant egomaniacal cavalryman in the earlier picture with mr flynn playing virginian and later confederate hero general j e b or jeb stuart errol took on the custer part for they died with their boots on once again the warner brothers propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the warner s repertory company are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity and all is really happening right before our very own eyes major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses such as elizabeth bacon mrs custer co star olivia de havilland ned sharpe arthur kennedy samuel bacon gene lockhart chief crazy horse anthony quinn californy charlie grapwin major taipe stanley ridges general phillip sheridan john litel callie the bacon s maid hattie mcdaniel the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited though skilled players such as joe sawyer eleanor parker minor watson tod andrews irving bacon roy barcroft lane chandler spencer charters frank ferguson francis ford william forrest george eldridge russell hicks william hopper hoppity hooper eddie keane fred kelsey sam mcdaniel patrick mcvey frank orth eddie parker addison richards ray teal jim thorpe all american himself minerva urecal dick wessel gig young and many many more the film moves very quickly particularly in the early goings then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years the assignment of custer as a colonel in the th cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn in montana under the guidance of director griffith veteran raoul walsh the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions from the very serious exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos as with most any of mr walsh s films he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy farce actually as previously mentioned this is much more factual than its predecessor santa fe trail last time we ll mention it honest schultz scout s honor however that is not to say that it wasn t without a few little bits of artistic and literary license as indeed just about any biopic will have it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of literary license is that business about custer s being accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general it just didn t happen that way yet the gag both helped the film to move along while it underscored the whole light carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film director walsh and mr flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident being the massacre by the lakota sioux the cheyenne and the fukowi of custer and his th cavalry at the little big horn at the time of its occurrence june custer s last stand was as big an incident and shock to the americans national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor december or the atrocities perpetrated by the islamic fascists to new york s twin trade towers and the united states armed forces headquarters in the pentagon arlington virginia on september just as so many films of that period of world war ii and the years immediately before there were so many incidents in it that were if not intentionally done were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period poodle schnitz 
when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland they died with their boots on is most likely the film remembered best it is the sweeping saga of general custer flynn told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon dehavilland through his tenure during the american civil war and finally with his death at little big horn director raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts rewritten by screen writers wally kline and aeneas mackenzie until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion hence the battle against chief crazy horse anthony quinn is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians california joe charley grapewin and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nation s first peoples flynn who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold schwartzenegger to two parts albert schweitzer has never been more ignoble he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine resident warner stock players arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them overall then despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn they died with their boots on is ample film fodder for a saturday matin e or sunday night cooing with one s sweetheart warner s dvd is pretty nice looking although film grain is often obvious the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep solid blacks and very clean whites some fading is obvious during scene transitions the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level 
the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful arthur kennedy never more villainous anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little big horn the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight however i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywood s golden age 
it s true that they died with their boots on gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer s errol flynn life and career but a remarkable one especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn because it is not a given that a movie tries to portray both the us american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse anthony quinn in a favorable light i m almost tempted to say that little big man in its unqualified anti custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison further one should not be mislead by the title of the picture this isn t just a movie about the battle of the little big horn it s a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet the famed civil war hero the indian fighter and last but not least the husband the movie begins with custer s time at the west point military academy where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits during a punitive military exercise he meets his future wife elizabeth bacon olivia de havilland who like custer himself is a native of monroe michigan custer intends to court her but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away custer s legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg while on leave he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth who promises him her hand in matrimony immediately after the war custer and elizabeth bacon are married with the civil war over custer is demoted doesn t get a real command and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small professional american army as he starts to drink his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general in chief winfield scott custer is given the command of the us th cavalry which he trains to be an elite unit neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horse s cause but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle they died with their boots on though short on historical accuracy is as good as war movies and westerns in the s got both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming the only minus and that s why i can t give this picture a full is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants elizabeth s servant callie is the stereotypical overweight good natured superstitious black mammy it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans just a couple of years later the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers needless to say that they died with their boots on omits the fact that custer s overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart and doesn t mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn nevertheless custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station gettysburg trevilian station and others though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggests in any event they died with their boots on is a well made war movie with western elements three outstanding performers flynn quinn and de havilland and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money which wouldn t be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come it would deserve a if it weren t for the racist minstrelization of african americans 
the film is excellent one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynn s performance is superb this is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn the cold calculating look on flynn s face as he does so is extraordinary much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p huntley jr as lt queen s own butler it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor 
now this is more like it one of the best movies i have ever seen despite it made very well on all aspects this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate loosen up there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand how entertaining and how captivating this movie was now this is what a movie ticket is all about you will get exacty what you want from this movie s genre and all naysayers are those with the anti flynn syndrome this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti elvis anti ali anti clinton anti kennedy syndromes usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art you will find this movie not only one of the best classics but also one of the best movies of all time i rate it the second best western ever right behind wayne s the cowboys 
this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custer s life and his last stand do not rent `they died with their boots on but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch the story starts out with custer s errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havilland errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of callie played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laugh the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the director s portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him i give it a thumbs up for this western film 
naturally along with everyone else i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the custer story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly seemed to counter the typical clich s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early th century for instance even while this film attempted to whitewash it s hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real life custer his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to custer s cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid custer s promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i half expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene custer s stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky custer s drinking problem is certainly not ignored and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy co as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didn t expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the th cavalry and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk 
as a history of custer this insn t even close custer dies to help the indians i am sure the other members of the th cav weren t consulted in that decision but as a western this is fun flynn looks and acts the part of the dashing cavalier and the garry owen is always nice to hear 
so keira knightly is in it so automatically we compare this film to attonement aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning these films are totally different the actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a team if you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche s damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined this film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath no its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in move you allow yourself to forget these stars and not to judge them as actors but let them become people you will truly ind yourself moved go on give it a go 
although they died with their boots on is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western not only is flynn the perfect custer the character actors are superb besides the action portion of the movie flynn and dehavilland s love scenes are very touching and believable flynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well 
errol flynn at his best as robin hood of the west fighting military red tape confederates indians and carpetbagger business crooks singlehanded to his great and final heroic end not to forget the ever reliable o de havilland as lady mary of the west never try to link this story to the facts and the real persons it doesn t work out just enjoy it because nobody ever claimed to make documentaries when raoul walsh and errol flynn co worked 
the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky dashing irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism it was robin hood all over again and flynn blossomed in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing and this one was no exception it also benefits from the return of former co star olivia de havilland despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership the part of strong minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynn s later films and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a romping adventure movie and the screen chemistry is rekindled for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effect the flynn de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this film s durability when most of flynn s other westerns held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly cursory despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out schoolboy fashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but it s a trifle too morally convenient however these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players memorably including anthony quinn in an all but wordless role as the sioux leader errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal charmingly sheepish looks unexpected sweetness mischievous twinkles flash point indignation cheerful fellowship and sheer high octane charisma he s a reckless braggart but you can t help but like him and it s hard to go away without the tune of garryowen threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter this is one of flynn s lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered 
this is awesome there is no partnership quite like errol and olivia there love is genuine i m yet this flick is as captivating now as i m sure it was years ago raoul walsh is an under rated genius his direction is so sweeping so broad yet so intimate the last scene between colonel custer flynn and his wife de havilland almost brought me to tears not easy for a yr old guy its so heart wrenching there is also a deep christian message implicit here the faith custer has in taking your glory with you and the trust and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this a must see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american and military history from the inside patriotic for all the right reasons i knew errol flynn was a star and de havilland was a screen legend this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest 
george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general custer in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments in spite of his poor standing he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error custer receives a promotion in rank before this can be corrected he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero custer returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart libby who is played by olivia de havilland libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a treaty with crazy horse the leader of the sioux when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de havilland s depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining the reviewer would rate this a star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land 
whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the th century libby and george were married for years until the little big horn what s not known to today s audience is that libby survived until during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing but if done from libby s point of view they could be understood and forgiven sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer he was retired and replaced by george b mcclellan in late while custer was still at west point i m not sure they ever met but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema errol flynn and olivia dehavilland this was the last of eight films they did together the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libby s farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign both their performances olivia s especially was a high point in their careers at warner brothers we know through history that custer is riding to his doom that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy if your eyes don t moisten you are made of marble as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action you can t beat this film at all 
great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color wow 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although i ve heard that the film isn t very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn t until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was i ll give this film out of 
although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer this remains the best film made about custer the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen which was a favourite of custer is played the film should have more villains because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best 
this is a wonderful film as a film it gets an out of as a filmed piece of accurate history one wishes to be more loving but it is a out of and i think i am actually being very charitable what was he like that man of horse and saber who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes opinionated militant bumptious bloody handed ambitious clever too clever indian foe indian friend and national hero his death in was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington lincoln jackson and grant lee and sherman jackson it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career the overly ambitious hot spur that his reputation declined yet to this day george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our history s military annals to lose his last battle i can t really think of a similar one maybe general jonathan mayhew wainwright forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march but wainwright survived the march and the second world war custer has appeared in more films than far better generals due to the western adventures and little big horn pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film but even in the legend was still potent olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth john ford would have fully understood this and approved it so we get the view that he was a hot spur but he was patriotic although almost pushed out of west point by demerits which was true custer was in the class of and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year you see most of the so called military talent from west point from robert e lee down was southern and joined the confederacy the union needed every northern point man they could find custer s civil war career should be given closer study he was attached to the staff of general in chief george b mcclellan and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare but he was a cavalryman and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and sherman s buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek which ended the threat of the confederacy in the shenandoah valley it also hit custer hard on a personal level his close west point friend stephen ramseur joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer mortally wounded custer sat with ramseur all through the latter s last night alive following the war things fell apart he wanted to make his brevet major generalship permanent it wasn t as it was a battlefield promotion they only had a lt colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier he tried to play politics making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot he supposedly admired the indians he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west but he caused a genuine military massacre in of indian women and children that ended with a court martial later during the s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians that went up to the secretary of war william belknap who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit it ruined belknap and left a black eye on the grant administration it put him into the doghouse with grant and sherman who was belknap s former commander and sheridan barely saved his career then he was sent on the final big horn campaign and immortality arrived that career is worth a real film but would it be too critical should we hold a man of the s to the standards of would we like that done to us in a hundred years certainly it could happen but i m not sure we d like it custer style fit flynn like a glove with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero s character in support actors like sidney greenstreet stanley ridges arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends foes or even treacherous sneaks kennedy as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be 
can you capture the moment when first you hear rain on a roof some things are beyond the sum of their parts expressing the poetry of life the things that matter poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to extend everyone s knowledge of himself and the world around him bob dylan named himself after him so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas a simple biopic could have missed the point writer sharman macdonald has taken a different better approach in the edge of love she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them the lives of four friends dylan who lusts and loves to the full wife caitlin sienna miller his feisty support war hero william cillian murphy who saves him from a street brawl and then there s his childhood sweetheart vera dear vera take your breath away vera she s caitlin s closest friend william s wife and like a muse the star in dylan s dark sky it all kicks off in the london blitz with bomb shelters in the underground enter vera an impressive keira knightley under makeshift stage spotlights she meets dylan for the first time again in years her heart is flushed their eyes shine through the smoke of the room the purity of their former passion dylan native welsh speaker matthew rhys is no sanctified sanitised poet master of his vices he must experience them all fully he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera the edge of love is a visual treat the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers as a lush love story it s pretty good as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives not bad at all and as a tribute to a great man inspiring the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson granddaughter of the real william and vera think of all the things that you don t want me to write about she said because i have to have carte blanche for macdonald the limits were if she should cause offence to dylan s memory but for many artists especially men the limits are those which wife and family could set on them a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues and will even put her children s interests before her own this occasionally happens the other way round as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth in the hours in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera these two women become closest buddies it is one of the main and very beautiful themes of the film the film s colours tell a story in themselves in a drab wartime britain caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey shortly after meeting vera s lit up in lights stage persona we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes sparkling in a darkened railway carriage her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan but vera s lipstick red brightness is less enduring for her marriage is second best even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images in a manner similar to poetry s juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy giving birth or is it abortion we are not told immediately pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day constant echoes of dylan s poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now a light beyond the horrors of the world a different way of seeing things i ll take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no one died ever says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach elsewhere caitlin recalls childhood with vera we re still innocent in dylan she says there s a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette not literally perhaps a time to be inspired enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year 
the custer legend a la warner brothers epic there s no casting against type here with the flamboyant flynn as the flamboyant custer in this rousing tribute not only to custer but to the men of the th cavalry the story traces the life of the famed boy general from his turbulent days at west point to his final fight at the little big horn great liberties are taken with facts here and we are presented with a custer that is much more sympathetic to the plight of the redman than history relates but this one is done on such a grand scale the battle scenes alone provided employment for every extra in hollywood down beat ending and all this is great fun 
all in all an excellent movie from that time and source coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii provided you don t take it at all seriously the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say jfk this one may actually be more honest about it though as it essentially admits along the way that it s not to be taken as particularly fact based but more of a stylishly semi heroic portrayal it s worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today the ny times review conceded that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film described the biographical account of custer s life as fanciful and pointed out that the presentation of custer s motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts they could have really gone overboard in building up custer one supposes but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around but appropriately determined principled and inspirational flynn and dehavilland doing their th movie together in years and their last are so comfortable together and play off each other so easily at this point that it s not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here with a first time pairing it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer but these two make it work the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together the greatly underrated michael curtiz but given that he had worked with them on the previous year s similar themed santa fe trail it s understandable if he chose to opt out of this one they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade both terrific so we can t really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh raoul walsh the director here is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences which are outstanding and everything else outdoors the interior scenes are a little more uneven but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well as does warner bros outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces greenstreet gene lockhart anthony quinn arthur kennedy etc i would have liked it better if kennedy s character had been a bit less standard i generally like his work but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene the part could have been better written and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle as he d only been in films for one year walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together various highlights include the depiction probably imagined of the genesis of garryowen as the cavalry theme the last half hour is particularly outstanding especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership followed by the final battle scenes a thoroughly rousing adventure of 
dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer the dashing jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless headstrong cadet through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians olivia de havilland flynn s co star in several other films scores as the devoted adoring libby bacon and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse the film s battle scenes are excellent the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers hammers the confederate army into submission custer s last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle a savage clash between red men and white with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men great direction cinematography casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic 
i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins louden s perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the s i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonna s character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie pure beauty and genius 
nicole finn madonna is just being released from prison although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record louden griffin dunne is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law louden will be driving around the city anyway in his future mother in law s rolls royce picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector nicki however starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving between big cats taxi drivers hit men bridesmaids and a wedding cake with guns lawyer louden knows he s not in kansas anymore is there a way out of the madness this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue madonna and dunneare perfect foils to each other making their connection uproarious as they play out their roles as an ex con and an uptight button down lawyer respectively the script is laudable in it s ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one and the next everything secondary from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes are also quite nice if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy rent this movie for them you will both be cheerio pronto 
i have to rate this movie at a i m sorry but i think it s classic comedy then if you re rating it to other madonna movies well what you wanna tell me it wasn t her best movie ever didn t mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later please this movie deserves much more credit than it gets plus i like to think of it as an a sociological study into the lifestyles of the s remember when you could shoplift from sam goody and cartier in the same day remember when women wore bushy eyebrows proudly so it was no last emperor it was still good there are certain movies i d be willing to watch everyday three actually that pep up my day and make me smile if you like who s that girl then i d also recommend party girl and romy and michelle s high school reunion 
i haven t been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now however i thought i would comment on this film this film mistaken one of them as well as madonna was panned by the critics they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews first madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first she plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didn t give her a fair shake when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting she was absolutely hysterical as was the film griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film if you take a look at his filmography you will see he is quite an accomplished actor as far as the movie itself this is something similar to pretty woman but came years before the roberts gere success it s a goof ball comedy with lots of site gags slapstick and one liners some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor i know this doesn t tell you much about the movie however i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun peace gary
nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry never boring always thinking positively good with animals okay as one reviewer wrote a bit too much peroxide lipstick and eyebrows only madonna could get away with that but that s why i love nikki finn she s not your ordinary girl she makes things happen always exciting to be around and always honest sure she steals but she doesn t rob or murder unless you re out to do her in she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed she knows what to take and what can t be stolen if you need a favor from her she s in bottom line she knows how to enjoy life nikki is always loving which is why she has a way with wild animals and completely dedicated to those she loves and who love her who s that girl she s the girl for me 
when i see a movie i usually seek entertainment but of course if i know what genre the move is then i will seek what it is meant to do for example if it is a deep film i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying but who s that girl is not a deep film but it is entertaining nonetheless it s a campy sort of film that s a joy to watch there s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts i ve watched it when i was younger the cast is always entertaining as usual i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasn t the typical male heartthrob at the time haviland morris also stars and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too overall a delight 
why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down it is cute and funny exactly what it is meant to be madonna wasn t out to prove herself as an oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow she was just doing what the character called for and she did it well i loved her in this movie it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita the soundtrack is excellent too it is no better or no worse than any cheesy s flick to all the critics just don t take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it madonna is a goddess 
in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life the highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer not content with this forever jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people how many people will be interested in a loner something who s best friend is a cat after several failed attempts at getting a girl including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals david brents fusion of flashdance and mc hammer in the office disco s dead says jon he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself naturally they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat fortunately jon s new girlfriend is allergic to cats with slicker animation than past tv specials this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends 
this movie is so good i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im now plus the acting was great and madonna is my idol and she did a phat job alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why 
one of the funniest most romantic and most musical movies ever definitely worth renting buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography the animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie a definite must for madonna fans o 
for late s cheese this really isn t so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand theft thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for razzies as well as oscars i m curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper bronxy accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after who s that girl
fantastic madonna at her finest the film is funny and her acting is brilliant it may have been made in the s but it has all the qualities of a modern hollywood block buster i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes fantastic 
i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 
if this film had been made in the s or s critics and fans alike would have praised it i myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end it s not a timeless piece and has not aged well over the years but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless as for mrs ritchie s acting in the film not the best on the planet but it adds to the film s unique slapstick comedy aspirations and showcases madonna s often underrated sense of comedic timing madonna plays nikki finn an ex convict who was framed for a crime she didn t commit griffin dunne plays the hapless future groom puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station where a series of unfortunate events occurs thus creating the plot and there is one folks give the film a shot you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is 
madonna gets into action again and she fails again who s that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people don t want that she s successful both as a pop star and a movie star the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title track single was agreat hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth isthat madonna failed as an actress cause the script was quite weak butit s not so bad especially for those who like the s it s such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie at the end it s very funny to watch it 
i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it i also like madonna s character and i do not agree that she played herself she has created a character and a sympathetic one my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love the humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybody s cup of tea but it s their problem not of the film i found this film wholesome and sunny in fact the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day and madonna can act just take off your glasses of negative thinking 
 what s his name loudon loudon what clear that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was released i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue madonna plays nikki finn a young woman jailed for a crime she didn t commit when she gets out she decides to seek revenge griffin dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his fianc e s father john mcmartin the future father in law asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications aplenty some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only but on the other hand i can t imagine her doing it in her normal voice this film shows madonna s comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fianc e yes it s predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it times more 
i love this movie sure i love it because of madonna but who cares it s damn funny alanis rocks when i first saw this film in the theatres back in i thought it was all out hilarious madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky funky look the all time funniest part is when madonna nikki screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi and also when griffin dunne louden trips and falls at the apartment interview scene alanis rocks madonna s character nikki steals shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time didn t rob nothin when you rob a store you stick up the cashier we busted a few tapes there s a bit of a difference i love that it s classic alanis rocks i don t know why this movie got slammed the way it did i see nothing wrong with it course maybe if you re a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome anyone out there who wants to see some funny classic entertainment then watch who s that girl and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist alanis will always rock ya completely to the end so does madonna in this film and just entirely her acting is superb 
[contains spoilers ] garfield and his owner jon arbuckle were in a rut they basically had no life at all all they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric he needed a life so he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman a singles bar was a great place to start unfortunately when the music started and jon hit the dance floor we see what made disco die jon killed it jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store he ended up feeling down in the mouth literally the laundromat was no prize either when jon and his would be date get a glimpse of each other s underwear jon tried to act all buff at the beach but soon he angered a real buff guy which left jon feeling once again down in the mouth literally jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by no avail jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat a fat man walked up and stomped jon s guitar it was hopeless fortunately for jon an ad flashed on the tv an ad for lorenzo s school for the personality impaired it guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps jon and garfield attend the class the building didn t exactly look the same way it did on tv nor did lorenzo act as peppy as he did on tv jon sat next to a pretty girl named mona so while lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself checking your pulse and pretending to speak a foreign language jon and mona get to know one another they leave together forgetting all about garfield at home jon and mona just sat on the porch and talked garfield was jealous of mona for fear that she would take jon away from him garfield envisioned the future jon and mona get married she moves in and soon she gives birth to a little arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling garfield s tale back to the present garfield would not stand for it he tried to get jon to get rid of mona until she started scratching behind his ears but then jon learned that mona was allergic to cats so that was basically the end of their relationship but they still saw each other every now and then and garfield was sure to be with them another hilarious garfield tv special this one was made during the run of tv s garfield and friends garfield was slimmed down somewhat somewhat since hie early s cartoons the scenes of jon trying to pick up chicks is funny so is the one where the fat guy stomps on jon s guitar good ol lorenzo music is back as garfield thom huge is jon frank welker the third man of voices is lorenzo and june foray the woman of voices is mona if you like garfield then i recommend you see garfield gets a life today it along with here comes garfield and garfield on the town were just released on dvd so check them all out today you are guaranteed a good time hey has garfield ever let you down before 
don t listen to what the critics have always said about this cute charming little movie madonna is great in this clever comedy i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it everyone always enjoyed it it s actually a great movie for kids too 
i kid you not yes who s that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonna s films that bombed but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan in susan madonna s character is relegated to being second fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with no disrespect to rosanna but in wtg madonna plays this zany outrageous character only done in an s style while it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of madonna s best and one of her most underrated films madonna plays nikki finn an ex con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didn t commit she s being released from jail after four years of good behavior griffin dunne who is also a very underrated actor plays louden trott a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station of course when these two get together that s when the madness happens sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest on his roof this movie parodies everything rich people the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy louden s rolls royce the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town and dunne s stuck up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city played by haviland morris who was jake s girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles hilarious plus dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby plus madonna had a great platinum blonde s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg madonna is the queen of deadpan acting there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly it turns out to be funny that s how some of the best comedy should be played straight madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark sexually charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game some people say madonna cannot act and that is fine people are entitled to their opinion but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies it s still a fun screwball comedy of the s not for everyone i m sure some of you will dislike it so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans but you never know you might be surprised and like it interesting note one of madonna s friends from her early s new york club days coati mundi who plays raoul was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band 
if you like madonna or not this movie is hilarious i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release however over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun sure there are some bad lines cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast she is cute funny and is the only comedic role of her movie career madonna usually just plays herself in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film she really seems like somebody else for once of course the film is directed by james foley who filmed the dramatic and haunting at close range with sean penn christopher walken and co stars griffin dunn after hours who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material the story is nothing genius and don t expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun clean s romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see the soundtrack is also very notable and contains madonna songs the hit who s that girl the hit causing a commotion and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads the look of love top hit in the uk and can t stop a left over pop ditty from the true blue sessions the year before it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd 
so madonna isn t meryl streep still this is one of her first films and a comedy at that give her a break sure the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w katherine hepburn bringing up baby for what it is though a piece of fluff it s quite a bit of fun to watch i ve yet to hear anyone that slams madonna s acting skills back it up w evidence or even adjectives other than awful bad or other such vague descriptive words if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing how about whitney houston she s had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldn t act her way out of a hatbox the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies get real people madonna bashing is so s 
i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc at the ziegfield at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now she had a couple of hits was very good in desparately seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium who s that girl gives madonna an actual role to play which is not just a variation of her own personality she does the madcap heroine routine better than you might think griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans the story involves a huge cat named murray a bride to be who has slept with every cabbie in nyc a mean father in law and a key there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path all the elements of a screwball comedy intact sir john mills is seen briefly he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side complete with a rain forest and everything compared to most madonna movies the ones i ve been able to tolerate anyway this is fantastic on its own its not that bad ps the concert was lousy 
watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine it s sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure it s the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation he s very good in a small role as bracco s pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie 
i loved this movie you can t buy it rent it or find it but it s a keeper wonderful chemistry between braccho and walken and ferrar terrific non stop action and reactions loved it i ve watched my pirated copy maybe times in the last decade each time showing it to someone who never heard of it find this movie and watch it so many films are on tv over and over again without any of the wit and style of this little film i didn t know it was made for tv my copy is an track i pirated years ago i hope it lasts 
a quite easy to watch tale of thieves with that love hate type relationship between them chrisopher walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a scam bigger than he s letting on 
it s strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you ve seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i ve ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful you ll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a run n coke i know i did i m very glad i saw this movie it was just too nice to miss 
finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed s machomovie on a upn affiliate s midday saturday program would be misleading it deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads best attributes to its maximum advantage bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre do the streetwise troubled minds routine that they are so good at portraying for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la fuqua s training day dive back into the world of early s tv movies to find scam 
i am a huge fan of harald zwart and i just knew that i had to see this movie even though i can t say i m a soccer fan but watching this just filled my heart with joy and i had a great time in the movies watching it bj rn fast nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting they grow with the movie and makes it what it is even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie there is surprisingly little soccer in it the whole idea is to show the six guys making up the word n o r w a y on their trip to the world cup in soccer playing in germany this year if you re only gonna see one norwegian movie this year this is the one 
this was a great movie it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy so what makes a movie great technical details i think that if that were the sole criteria our culture would be the poorer for it so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to mozart the point is it is one of the best movies of it s type i ve seen the women are all beautiful as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made it has a little of everything a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets wayne s world there is plenty of charm and a reasonable albeit predictable storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen joe estevez may not have his brothers career but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in was that intentional if you re attracted to the box rent the video you won t regret it as is promised it is good non violent erotic fun 
is this a bad movie of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or schindler s list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure adolescent fun there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so unashamedly i say again if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it 
i`ve seen this movie twice both times on cinemax the first time in it`s unrated version which is soft core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down cut all the sex and most of the nudity out version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world no pun intended unfortunately in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out as are all the other sex scenes rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars stallone sheen travolta etc trying to act we also get appearances by b queen linnea quigley and burt ward robin from the old batman series 
this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that s partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you ll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time don t be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it s more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond 
we open in a doctors room of some sort a girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor he asks her questions silence follows he continues to ask questions ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere the story is about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in a mental home after an incident that happened before hand they are greeted on their arrival by their trying way too hard to be nice but so totally evil stepmother who the girls obviously hold resentment for as time goes on at home the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls and to top it all off there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls recovery this film is amazing it has twist turns and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming it almost makes you cry at some points i know i had a teary moment of two specifically the cupboard scene but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits the soundtrack is faultless the furnishings in the house and the use of colour are fantastic a pure joy for the eyes this is a definite must see for all asian movie fanatics or any sort of movie fan an easy 
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen it s so full of details and every time you see it you ll find new things like then the father is in the shower but still only hears one voice and when the girls flute they can t do it at the same time cause then there would be two girls and there aren t i have some problem finding out about in the middle of the movie their uncle visit them but why does his wife freak out else a fantastic movie the best asian movie ever i hope people will enjoy it there have been so many movie where the main character is skit so the machinist secret window and so on but this movie is way better than them 
 tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i ve seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father s home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she s prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you ve seen it s a hell of a puzzler 
another asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well major spoiler warning the movie starts pretty simple two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother especially the elder one and they seem to ignore their father all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didn t know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister revealed when the stepmother actually the sister s alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there finally my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack very creepy out of 
what can i say about this film that won t give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused if you ve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you ll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on i m not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and don t mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl 
disgused as an asian horror a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family i was really surprised at the depth of this movie director ji woon kim s decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies a tale of two sisters tels the story as it s name suggest of two sisters su mi and the younger su yeon who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmother s gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience so i ll just leave it at that the plot is very tightly written with the characters nicely fleshed out ji woon kim s focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character from the protective su mi the weaker su yeon the visibly uninterested father to the stepmother s frantic and later deadly behavior there is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it the actors superbly fit their roles it is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat ji woon kim s direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the film s horroresque scenes while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film a tale of two sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride with it s strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better 
this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches then they made a movie out of it the leads are not pros and you can see that but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away norway is known for making crappy movies no offense but i had a good feeling about this one even thou i m not interested in football i wanted see it the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them if you re ever gonna see a norwegian movie let it be this one 
typically a movie can have factors like arousing good feel sense of purpose plot etc there s always something that can be taken out of movies its just a matter of how compelling the reason is for me to own it in my collection tale of two sisters as they call it when it was released in my country has tremendous feel and an eventually mostly self explaining plot i love horror movies that revolve around a house titles that come to mind are the others the haunting the haunting of hell house this movie will be a another great example that i will remember the movie had extremely rich colour in the way the house was decorated in the clothes that the characters wore in the open skied daylight scenes that is in contrast to most horror movies which typically makes use of desaturated tones and gloomy environs think honogurai mizu no soko kara dark water which is another show i like that gives this film a sense of aesthetics and joy when it wasn t in its more gripping moments the characters are extremely believable this may be partly attributed to the familiar setting of this movie maybe domestic issues are easier for both myself as well as the actors to identify with and the actors become their characters with exceptional finesse the director toys with timelines in order to give the audience the story in bits and pieces allowing them to come to their own terms of interpretation instead of presenting everything in a linear fashion this is a positive aspect of this film in my opinion and perhaps it is my interpretation of this movie that allows me to find it enjoyable i would definitely look out for this on dvd 
i must say i m an avid horror movie fan and currently i can t get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gore this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m night s sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isn t too much i ve never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just startled the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that it s great 
the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you haven t seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the end don t forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldn t help stick on my seat till the end conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood don t miss it 
if you consider yourself a horror movie fan chances are you ve seen hideo nakata s ring and dark water they re superb and ring s making its way smoothly into hollywood maybe dark water will be adapted soon too while ring is almost pure heart pounding and nerve breaking a tale of two sister is both nerve breaking and mind twisting along with the other i consider this korean flick a brilliant and smart ending horror movie the only flaw this movie has is some consider its first minutes rather slow it s actually typical with korean and japanese movies i consider it carefully planned rather than slow think of it as calm moment before the storm with thorough introduction of characters imho viewer will get involved more intimately with the character one of korean and japanese movies strongest point like ring a tale of two sister doesn t overdo ghastly appearance rather they let our mind do the intimidating job itself that way it s scarrier and horrifyingly classy at the same time i won t be surprised if hollywood remakes this movie after bringing ring and grudge ju on over this flick is not that good by the way i rate it don t miss it 
to most of us life is an unfolding process of love for others like soo mi however it is dominated by darkness and fear based on the korean folk tale jangha and hongryun kim ji woon s brilliant gothic horror story a tale of two sisters revolves around two sisters soo mi lim su jeong and soo yeon mun geon yeong who are part of a dysfunctional family that live together in a creepy victorian style mansion feeling alienated from the world they cling to each other for survival with the older soo mi obsessively protecting the younger soo yeon against danger for soo mi however not coming to terms with the circumstances surrounding her mother s death means mental illness and a mind at odds with reality while we may recognize staples such as haunted houses with apparitional sightings doors that open and close on their own a cruel and overbearing stepmother and other events of high strangeness a tale of two sisters superbly explores deeper psychological meanings including the inability to let go of inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge soo mi says do you know what s really scary you want to forget something totally wipe it off your mind but you never can it can t go away you see and and it follows you around like a ghost there is a time line but it is left for the viewer to unravel the plot cannot be summarized only suggested and the film keeps us wondering whether what is happening on screen is objective or subjective in the film s opening soo mi an obviously disturbed young woman is being questioned by a doctor in a setting that looks like a mental institution when the doctor asks her to describe what happened that day the film flashes back to when soo mi and soo yeon return to the home of their father moo hyeon kim kap su and stepmother eun joo yum jung ah the stepmother is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant but it is obvious that it is soo mi who is really hurting as the girls try to readjust they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house which may be nightmares or supernatural occurrences soo mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her and oozes black blood a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions a monster emerges from between the legs of one of the sisters people mysteriously disappear from photographs and many other maniacal schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer dangling on the edge of insanity while we sense that much of the story is the projection of someone s mind we do not know whose and the film keeps us constantly challenged at least until an important clue is offered in the film s second half shot in gorgeous low light cinematography a tale of two sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that transcends all the scares and there are plenty it is haunting in more than one sense of the word and its images may stare back at you when you least expect or want them to while the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the way of light it shows us where we can end up if we opt for the darkness in the words of a wise observer blame is never the answer whether it is blaming yourself or others rather the answer lies in stepping out of judgment entirely both of yourself and others forgiveness and understanding have great power of healing 
three words piece of art this film is just great it s beautiful sad frightening and thought provoking at the same time the score constantly stays in my head the acting is wonderful the scenery scary and beautiful at the same time it was more by chance than on purpose that i saw this movie at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good well i saw the title a tale of two sisters which sounded very interesting then i read the summary of the plot and decided you don t just watch this film you ve gotta buy it said done i bought this film and was hooked from the very first minute the plot kept me interested from the beginning till the end the twist near the end of the film made me scream i really didn t see something like this coming and the ending scene made me cry it just made me cry it was so sad well i recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that combines an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere although you should be aware of the fact that the ending is as i mentioned before a very sad one but this just fits in the mood of the film doesn t it 
if there is such a thing as beautiful horror this film is one of the best in this genre it is a horror movie which despite not being void of gore scenes relies more on psychology and masterful building of the tension in order to create thrills and it is one of those movies so beautifully filmed where each scene is a full world of symbols and details all serving the scope and genre that it can be called but beautiful it is not an easy story with two sisters returning to their father and step mother mansion after having spent some time in a psychiatric institution they cope hardly with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world of theirs defending them against the adult world so the film seems to be at its most external layer actually the film slowly evolves to something very different at slow pace but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty so i will not say much more watch it it is one of the best in the genre of far east horror films that conquered recently the world cinema and it really shows that they succeeded to do it for good reasons 
let me just say i love the horror genre to the extent that i see every single one that i can get my hands on regardless except really low quality b movie horrors which i could do without and recently have become a big fan of eastern horrors little did i know that a korean horror would be the one that tops my list beating off heavyweights such as the japanese ringu or the american ring or even quality us movies such as the sixth sense and the others and the widely acclaimed hong kong horror the eye previously the ring had stood as my favourite horror but it seems to me that i prefer the beauty of the tale of two sisters any day the story is extraordinary and rather open to interpretation thus allowing repeat viewings although chances are you ll want to watch this again and again just because the movie is so masterfully shot the story is likely one of the best in the genre to date the acting is top notch too from the entire cast and the scares when they come have the potential to rattle you like anything within the ring i did find myself glued to the screen at those points unable to take my eyes off still i am glad it didn t come back to haunt me later that sadako samara did from the ring after all such feelings are unpleasant and the tale of two sisters leaves you with an uneasy feeling but one that hopefully won t leave you without sleep but leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special but do remember if you don t understand the plot after the first viewing a repeat viewing is more than advised i personally didn t have time for this since it was late so i flicked through scenes on the dvd some numerous times until i had a good synopsis in my head and after looking on the net seemed ihad pretty much nailed it on the widely agreed interpretation and the satisfaction from solving a puzzle like that is wonderful all in all a masterfully crafted horror that is unlikely to produce the same level remake its been purchased by dreamworks simply because of the korean content and everyone is advised to catch this in the theaters or on dvds while they can its one of the best you will get unfortunately due to the type of movie this is there is no way to even talk about the story without spoilers so its best to do what i did watch it without knowing a single thing except its a tale of two sisters and be prepared for something that is unlikely to be matched for some time 
this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of a tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore it is a psychological horror movie which piques the viewer s curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide a clear answer pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don t expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular a tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this the true fear of a tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares it is a psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called asian horror genre indeed it would be a mistake to align a tale of two sisters with films like ringu and the grudge this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints some requiring no suspension of credulity others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly whichever way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general 
every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what s going on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b bs and lots of blood if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts ch without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation and don t forget to switch the light off my points on different aspects direction acting atmosphere sound effect total 
i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen well done 
the finest short i ve ever seen some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers there s irony in that comment and little merit the acting is all up to noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly i might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect this is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty a beautiful short film fwiw i was pleased at the picasso reference since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent like i assume most people until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for 
many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years i was inclined to agree with this until the influx of asian horror films a trend which has admittedly grown dull however it has produced some true classics and a tale of two sisters for me at least stands out as an exceptional piece of cinema and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time based vaguely on a korean folktale it tells the sad story of two mentally troubled sisters residing with their father and stepmother after experiencing a few problems on their first night back at home they determine to stick together and deny their stepmother access to their close relationship the tension rises and there is the inevitable snap but what happens after this requires more than a pair of eyes as the story takes several twists and the scares become more emotional and quite real by the end you may need a few moments to absorb it all and piece it together in your own mind but it is exactly this pairing of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic one to watch again and again if only to work it all out 
this isn t so much a review of a tale of two sisters as it is a discussion of some of the smaller plot details so i advise you not to read this review if you haven t seen the film because doing so will absolutely ruin a few surprises for you in a way a tale of two sisters is far from original at least from a purely superficial aspect some of its iconography is taken straight from ring or dark water while the storyline itself especially what brendt sponseller calls the rubber reality aspect of the narrative is reminiscent of films like fight club lead character interacts with someone created in their mind mulholland drive character creates alternate reality in a psychogenic fugue as well as other minor aspects of lost highway jacob s ladder and basically every film under the sun dealing with mental illness plus amenabar s films the others abre los ojos memento particularly with regards to the torturous nature of memory et al thankfully all these similarities do not detract from the film s overall emotional impact and i personally found a tale of two sisters an extremely moving and rewarding experience many people have commented on the confusing nature of the narrative but i personally found the storyline to be fairly self explanatory even if it is in part portrayed in a non sequential manner the narrative only becomes confusing for some because midway through the final third the story switches from a purely subjective setting ie soo mi s warped perception of reality to an objective one with a flashback at the end explaining the origins of soo mi s nervous breakdown and subsequent mental illness the shift in emphasis is bound to throw some people off guard but structurally i found it somewhat reminiscent of aforementioned mulholland drive even though we re not dealing with a character s perception of reality via a dream but instead their own schizophrenic tendencies something which in turn reminded me of another lynch movie lost highway to be honest i don t really regard a tale of two sisters as a horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a family s breakdown as well as an honest look at a character s mental illness and i hasten to add that fans of psychoanalytical cinema are going to love this film that aside the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i ve seen this side of wong kar wai s the performances are also fantastic without exception and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days it s very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest psychoanalytical approach but then each to their own if you can ignore some of the film s platitudinous aspects and simply take it for what it is at heart ie an extremely tragic heart breaking story then i see no reason not to recommend it 
i watch many movies but presently my genre number one is asian horror i have just bought this dvd and i initially found janghwa hongryeon an intriguing but confused film since i had not understood many parts of the story but i saw in imdb board a message titled explanation of a masterpiece all your questions answered faster load written by opiemar and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story i would like to congratulate opiemar for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers in the end i agree that janghwa hongryeon is a great korean film but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once like this film demands and without the great support of opiemar i would not be able to understand the story as a whole i intend to see this movie again in a near future my vote is eight title brazil medo fear 
two sisters su mi im soo jung and su yeon moon geun young return home with their father kim gap soo eun joo yeom jeong ah welcomes them but su mi s manner is bitter to her su mi hates eun joo because the father let her act like the house wife after the sisters mother died seeing her attitude eun joo is getting to treat the sisters coldly and there grows a tense atmosphere among them as if called in by the atmosphere series of mysterious things occur in the house when su mi is hanging her dress in her wardrobe there have been already hung a lot of dresses of the same design when she put her diary into a drawer she finds another diary of the same kind there when she is sleeping in her bed with scared su yeon a nightmare awakes her and she finds a woman standing on her and a hand dangles out of the woman s skirt mysterious things occur to the other people too on the evening of next weekend eun joo s brother and his wife visit the family and they have a dinner together eun joo cheerfully talks about a crazy man she met when she was a child but nobody is interested in her talk she says the crazy man annoyed the brother but he says he doesn t know anything about the man listening to their talk the brother s wife has a panic after the dinner the conflict between eun joo and the sisters becomes at its worst eun joo pulls su yeon into a wardrobe and locks her in it su mi saves the crying out sister and complains to their father what eun joo has done to his daughter but his response is unexpected give me a break says he angrily su mi please don t make me tired any more and the following words out of the father s mouth are more shocking than what they have seen in the house to tell the truth i hate horror movies although i seated myself at a theater because my intuition told me the movie was something different i was regretting what my curiosity had made me act when it started showing the regret however had changed into joy for expectation ten minutes later this film is a tragic mystery more than a horror painful more than horrible beautiful more than sensational that may have a hard core horror fan disappointed but for a mystery fan like me this film is a must see out of 
i first saw this film two years ago in the cinema and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step mother their relationship with their step mother is strained to say the least with the step mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls the film though slants with oriental style ghost effects and horror which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear but is all the more intriguing the direction is incredibly good and the acting is stunning with the step mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film the large house adds eeriness and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat this film to me clearly shows why korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment you simply don t get anything like this in the western world sadly and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade highly recommended viewing in my opinion a real joy and scare 
i just saw a tale of two sisters last night and really enjoyed it i ve been a big fan of asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from south korea there aren t many jump out at you scares as in the usual american horror film but the director does maintain the off kilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyone s there s something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case it s the closet and the sink i also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner that the characters have together he s also good at revealing people s inner life and fragility through simple scenes such as the stepmother wiping off her make up in the mirror or her sitting in front of the flickering tv i think this film is mainly an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt hanging over you major spoilers ahead do not read any further if you do not want the twists of the movie revealed i was following the story pretty well but did start getting confused during the bag dragging part however i think the flashback at the end definitely tied everything together the film is very much like the machinist in the way two of the character s joint guilt eventually leads to mental breakdowns and delusions here s my interpretation of the film the su yeon that we see after the girls supposed return to the house is either the delusion of su mi or the actual ghost of su yeon that only su mi can see and interact with the initial stepmother that we see is in my opinion a delusion of su mi there is a real stepmother however and she first appears in the film when she s wearing the gray pantsuit i believe it s the real stepmother that the father is talking to on the phone throughout the first part of the movie and she doesn t appear until he pick her up and brings her to the house the stepmother before that point is imagined by su mi perhaps part of her split personality that explains the bizarre dinner party sequence when the stepmother s brother looks at her like she s crazy and doesn t remember anything that she recounts i think it was su mi acting out her stepmother part of her split personality the film shows this later in the bag dragging scene and scenes such as the stepmother wiping her make up in the mirror which is revealed later to actually be su mi wiping her make up in the mirror i think the ghosts in the house aren t entirely imagined by su mi and are either of su yeon or the mother or both in the final flashback it is revealed the su yeon was wearing the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died this is the green dress that they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the stepmother was looking under the sink also it s the hairpin that su yeon was wearing in the flashback that appears on the floor when the stepmother is looking under the sink the real stepmother in the end gets punished by the ghost of su yeon who comes for in a scene a little bit like the ring after that the flashback scene ties it all together in terms of how both the stepmother was mainly responsible for her death while su mi unintentionally played a supporting role i wonder if the mother that su yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry in the flashback is a ghost already perhaps by that point the mother had already killed herself in the closet that s left ambiguous other things that are suggested but not clearly explained in the film is that it seems like the stepmother at some point was a nurse perhaps taking care of the mother and somehow may have contributed to her death too it s not clear when her relationship with the father began and whether it caused the mother to kill herself it s also suggested that the mother had mental issues too requiring a nurse the stepmother alludes to this when she tells su mi you re beginning to take after your mother i don t think she meant just physically also if we accept that the initial stepmother that we see is actually su mi then there s the suggestion of incest too since the father sleeps with her is that why su mi freaks out and shouts don t touch me each time the father reaches for her in a later scenes is that the filthy things that you ve done that she alludes to in a later conversation with the father this film is interesting in it s capacity for different interpretations a few of the scenes however were kind of derivative such as the woman in the black crawling around scene which reminded me of the herky jerky movements of kayako in the ju on the grudge films also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring furthermore just the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from the sixth sense or the others overall i enjoyed it however and it will be interesting to see how the hollywood remake that s already in production turns out i have to be honest i liked both the ring and the grudge so i m not one of those snooty types who insist that remakes can t be good too one remake that i m really excited about is dark water coming out this summer i haven t seen the original japanese version yet but both films are definitely on my to see list 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made i ll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making it s practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute quite literally ji woon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels a seemingly insignificant object may be shown a rack of dresses two diaries a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack a bottle of pills etc but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer s intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid fire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness lest they miss something important in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this it s quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions he posits that ji woon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that in reality however nothing could be further from the truth a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention he would have noticed for example the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film these flashbacks convincingly contradict zaphod s assertion of complete subjectivity the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them can ji woon kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film i think not please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot get a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture you need only put them together remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that when completed bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe don t misunderstand me there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design spider forest perfect blue and donnie darko are perfect examples of this a tale of two sisters is not it s ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence i m ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort he apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible this is evident when he makes consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself just read the threads by opiemar within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious i d like to say more but i ve come to my word limit all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said 
i love horror films but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind the devil s backbone the exorcist for example this is that kind of film and it s not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be it is also really beautiful a tale of two sisters starts really slow so if you re in a hurry to see ghosts in the first minutes you will be disappointed actually this is not a ghost story though there are some it s something more complex and it s done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat a tale is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits because it really cares for its characters and the direction is flawless every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you re the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie the acting is superb specially from the stepmother and the main girl those two are worth the price of the ticket alone do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film 
perhaps i m one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of asian shockers is so over hyped films like ringu or the the eye which are praised all over the world simply didn t convince me and they looked more boring than frightening well this blunt opinion doesn t go for the south korean gem a tale of two sisters this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror tale that really gets under your skin the plot based on a local folklore tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all time greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tension building surely provokes feelings of great respect this is one of those few films that are impossible to label the events in two sisters qualify as mind bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait besides a mesmerizing story a tale of two sisters also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music good acting and innovative camera work the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door several sequences like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls room are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that i ve seen my share of spooky horror a tale of two sisters is a terrific movie adventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics a little warning for people with a short attention span though this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time it s also a film that requires repeated viewing even though no one will never really get it for a full 
the beauty the terror the poetry the horror the innocence the guilt maybe that s just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it i myself didn t even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie i just took a look at the nice cover art didn t even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvd player i only knew that it won several prices on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended the dvd cover read the most frightening film since the ring the grudge and dark water though the frightening part might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is a ghostly apparition with long black hair it s even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others this movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise twists and just when you think you ve had the conclusion whether you get it or not that s irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end this movie goes on a bit longer the cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night the camera work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not innovating angles some shots are pure poetry e g the top shot with the two sisters at the lake it all looks very stylish there are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense the story itself starts a bit slow but there s a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting there was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering peter jackson s heavenly creatures but when the horror kicks in it s quite effective there are also a few successful surprise scares in it damn i jumped right up from my sofa the musical score is great and at times when it s not supposed to be scary i couldn t help but noticing that it had sort of an italian feeling to it a bit strange for a korean movie but nevertheless a great score so much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround sound i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit it s more a mysterious horror drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level no matter how you look at it this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest it might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed so if you haven t seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your dvd player go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it s minutes running time there i hope i did a good job praising it without spoiling anything 
hehehe this was one of the best funny road movies ever i laughed so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves harald zwart is the producer known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool s it is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in soccer in germany and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious i couldn t stop laughing i haven t had so much fun in ages rumors say it will come a number two but i do not know it will be hard beating this one recommended to everyone it is a must see film i was suppose to see it at the cinema but i had work at the times it where shown and been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out got it today on dvd well worth it 
 a tale of two sisters is a brilliant south korean psychological horror that left me speechless the film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy the small cast of actors is truly excellent with lead im soo jung being especially memorable in the lead role the direction by kim ji woon is well handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous the plot is slightly confusing but some scenes are wonderfully eerie the action is rather slow but i was not bored in the slightest i was extremely curious and intrigued the house where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated a tale of two sisters is along with ringu and kairo one of the most original asian horror films i have ever seen watch this masterpiece as soon as possible my rating out of 
the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost horror films from the east has been dismal this film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on e bay or similar it is well photographed and the sound is superb viewing on a good screen and with a good or dts enabled sound system is recommended obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then i wouldn t bother with this dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here it is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences i would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant the ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope the plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way if i do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring we have however accepted straight copies of other peoples ideas for western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge pleasure from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic 
 a tale of two sisters or janghwa hongryeon is a true masterpiece brilliant psychological thriller heart wrenching drama and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully orchestrated package from the intricate plot to the beautiful cinematography to the absolutely perfect casting every aspect of this film is extraordinary for fear of revealing too much concerning the plot i will just say it is very satisfying while it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first it does a good job of explaining things in the end and whether you prefer psychological thriller drama or horror i promise you will not be disappointed from a technical standpoint its nearly flawless the set the cinematography lighting and especially the soundtrack all are captivating the waltz seemed an odd choice at first but proved to be an ingenious choice as for the casting we re talking absolute perfection i m su jeong is totally convincing as the defiant yet troubled su mi mun keun yeong is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister su yeon these two girls were magical on the screen i will certainly be looking into their other films yeom jeong ah is deceitfully cheerful and hauntingly evil as the stepmother finally kap su kim gives an excellent performance as the weary broken father i truly love this film if you have yet to see a tale of two sisters i strongly recommend locating a copy it is a real gem worthy of anyone s collection 
this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story ive had real life experiance with a boy like radio at the football program in my town weve had a mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team this movie is really true and i can identify with it a boy like radio just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living thats how radio feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man 
call it manipulative drivel if you will but i fell for it sure there could have been more character development yeah there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant movie of the week score but ed harris was impeccable cuba gooding adorable and touching and let s face it people in real life how many of us really get to know the motivation of others not many we did get a little glimpse into the coach s motivation a very provocative dialog in my opinion not to be soon forgotten so in my opinion this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his comfort zone to reach out to another human being and in the mean time touched the lives hundreds more a lesson we all need to me reminded of why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart you won t be disappointed and bring your kleenex 
radio will have you laughing crying feeling this story based on a true story is the perfect movie for a couple to view there s enough for both cuba gooding jr portrays the title character to perfection his performance is worthy of an academy award nomination the compassion of the movie is obvious the movie evokes many emotions i sincerely enjoyed this film 
excellent performances and a solid but not overplayed story helped this movie exceed my expectations this movie was far better than i was expecting after some of the reviews i had read but frankly those reviewers just got it wrong very inspiring and uplifting highly recommended 
i thought this was a really well written film i ve heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can t begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry everyone laugh and most everyone will leave smiling 
 having read the unemployed critic s review i went to a screening of radio not knowing what to expect thankfully the unemployed critic now appears to me anyway a frustrated film director movie critic his review is callous and totally uncalled for this is a movie that will make you laugh it will make you cry and in the end it will give you a moment of pause to paraphrase a line delivered by actor ed harris in the final barbershop scene and all this time that we thought we were teaching radio truth is he was teaching us he treats us all the time like we wish we treated each other some of the time yes the movie tugs at the heartstrings yes it is emotionally manipulative and yes cuba gooding jr in an oscar worthy performance is a little over the top at times see the christmas day dance scene but you know what so what every once in awhile the community of america needs to be reminded what tolerance can do for our great country we need to be reminded how great we can be this is a solid cast i was particularly pleased to see s epatha merkerson portraying radio s mother do something outside of law and order i always wondered is ms merkerson a great actor or is it the quality of writing delivered buy a strong cast on law and order after watching this movie it is easy to see that she is indeed a very fine actor also joining the cast in small but important and powerful roles is alfre woodard as the principal debra winger in a career resurrecting role of coach jones s wife and chris mulkey as protagonist frank clay we cannot over look ed harris s performance as coach harold jones after reflecting on this movie and having grown up in the deep south my self it is hard to truly appreciate mr harris and his contribution to this film as coach jones ed delivers a quiet rock solid performance that of a man on a mission coach harris will not let the town or circumstances divert him from what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do if you see this movie make sure you hang around for the end credits you will be in for a treat as the real james robert radio kennedy now in his mid s is shown still leading the t l hanna football team on to the field every friday night one final note if you were a teen in the mid to late s this movie is worth the price of admission for the sound track alone 
cuba gooding jr is back on top jesus he did a great job in this film i loved this movie its one of those feel good movies that makes you want to run out and volunteer at a mission or something anyway i would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat well worth the price of admission and as for cuba gooding jr just give him his next oscar right now 
i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early s i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i m not particularly interested in the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to it s franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiece 
i just got home from seeing radio i ve not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages and and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don t know why we can t have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis 
this is a very moving movie about life itself the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the forefront for all to see and hopefully understand it should teach the bigots of society that we are all humans and while some of us are gifted with a mind heart and sound body there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky or maybe we re the unlucky ones we don t always see the beauty in the world because we re wrapped up in our blind ambitions and see it only in one light what can this world do for me maybe we all wish we were like radio a loving happy individual who loves everyone 
as one who frequently goes to the movies i have to say that this has been one of the most impressive movies i have seen this year ed harris and cuba gooding jr gave outstanding performances allowing viewers to get lost in the various emotions and really feel for the characters it is nice to occasionally see a movie that does not depend entirely upon special effects but allows the characters of the story to touch the human psyche on many levels i wish hollywood would produce more movies of this calibre 
cuba gooding jr will win the oscar for best actor in and ed harris will win for best supporting actor what a beautiful and poignant film it is but be sure to bring along a box of tissues because if this film doesn t get to you then you have ice water in your veins it was the setting was in south carolina and the civil rights act was about ten years old we have a white high school football coach and teacher ed harris then there is a black retarded frightened but pleasant fellow cuba gooding whose greatest possessions including a radio are piled into a shopping cart which is also used as his bicycle ed harris takes a keen interest in the fellow for a reason explained much later on in the film he gives cuba the nickname radio and what follows is an absoutely riveting engrossing poignant exploration of the human soul the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece 
inspired by true events radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas i seen widely released in sometime it definitely is one of the year s best films of radio stars ed harris who is oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach harold jones coach jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game however coach jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by debra winger and sarah drew one day radio played by cuba gooding jr in his best performance since men of honor comes by the football field while the coach s team is practicing for the game some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building they then bang on the building and finally coach jones suspects something is wrong he comes over and helps radio who is frightened and from that point on coach jones and radio shares a very special bond radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events he also becomes coach jones s main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and radio the movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships the movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director michael tollin should be very proud of this film the thing i liked most about radio was how real it felt the performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes radio had a great mix of comedy and drama some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad in conclusion i feel that radio was very overlooked by critics only getting average reviews they must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get star reviews and something like school of rock can get or stars it doesn t make any sense to me also the performances as i mentioned before are top notch and oscar worthy in my opinion both ed harris who i think is underrated as an actor and cuba gooding jr should both get some kind on nomination for this movie radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big hollywood movies my final rating for radio is a 
cuba gooding jr and ed harris are touching this movie is really surprising it was enjoyable from start to finish the story is about mentally challenged man who helps out with a football team 
this is a movie you ll either love or hate i loved it if you are looking for suspense great special effects action sophistication cynicism etc you won t find it in this movie it is a feel good movie sentimental positive uplifting the heroes of the movie are coach jones played by ed harris a man of strength and integrity and radio cuba gooding jr a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world i guess i didn t find this movie to be sentimental hogwash as so many did because it felt very real to me i know people like these i ve seen jocks who think it s fun to pick on the vulnerable i ve seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable i ve seen people who think high school football is serious business i ve seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew i did laugh i did cry i left the movie feeling good remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world if there aren t people like them in yours you might not like the movie if you don t like a movie that shows the better side of human nature you ll hate it 
radio was a very good movie and honestly i never cry in movies but it had me pretty close to tears it really got to me when radio s mom died and he just wouldn t get out of his room i felt really sad about how if you were mentally retarded you wouldn t really be able to understand death i really liked the movie and it s a must see 
i m normally not a drama feel good movie kind of guy but once i saw the trailer for radio i couldn t resist not only is this a great film but it also has grreat acting cuba gooding jr did an excellent job portraying james robert kennedy a k a radio ed harris also did a fantastic job as coach jones i was pleasantly surprised to see some comedy in it as well so for a great story great acting and a little comedy i give radio a out of 
radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do the viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done the adversity that coach jones and radio both faced was both tragic and predictable people did not understand nor did they want to understand but in the end the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature intuition compassion and love coach jones is a high school teacher who cannot ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how it was sad the way coach jones and radio met the practical joke that terrified the life out of radio was enough to make you want to severely punish not only the boys involved but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it however on the positive side of the scale the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies this movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed ed harris was his usual brilliance gooding was flawless radio is an inspiration 
despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by franco micalizzi this film doesn t quite reach the level of joe d amato s similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book emmanuelle the joys of a woman emmanuelle arsan directed and had a smallish role in this film which mostly pornographically showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by zombie s al cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married orso maria guerrini drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by arsan herself despite beginning promisingly and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film shambles along plotlessly up until the less than spectacular finale much like d amato s emanuelle and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but don t get your hopes up there s no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldn t help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely cornball logic the film goes by 
 radio is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged james robert kennedy nicknamed radio and the football coach from the t l hanna high school harold jones cuba gooding jr is excellent as radio i would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies i watch with him are comedies ed harris is great as harold jones but this actor is great so this is not anything new the mentally challenged young man called james robert kennedy always walk around the t l hanna high school without bothering anyone and almost not noticed one day when the football s ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of johnny cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met one day cash decides to punish james mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up when coach jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help james who gets the nickname radio because of his passion for radios in general the movie shows how radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city i would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story it has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call normal radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that s a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives 
can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a south carolina town the answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap james kennedy understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene also the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience coach jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart radio directed by michael tolllin is a formula film inspired on a true story yet the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast coach jones is instrumental in getting the young man who is called radio because his passion for collecting them involved in sports a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life coming from a poor background radio lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach s intentions radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot at first then his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body the film owes a lot to ed harris and cuba gooding jr who make a great pair as the coach and radio mr harris one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence he gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past cuba gooding jr is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man the supporting cast is excellent s ephata merkerson one of the best actresses of her generation does interesting work as the mother of radio alfre woodard another good actress plays the high school principle with style debra winger only has a few scenes in the film radio while being sentimental will warm anyone s heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them michael tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us 
ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film it s a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didn t incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio 
this was unusual a modern day film which was ultra nice in fact it was so nice it bordered on being too hard to believe in parts as i watching this based on a real life story i was thinking nobody is this nice this tolerant mainly i was referring to ed harris role as coach jones i think they went a little overboard on his character but that s better than the reverse showing him worse than what he was in real life odd to see harris playing the role too since he has a long resume of playing nasty profane characters anyway i never complain about a nice feel good film and it is nice to see a bunch of well meaning kind people those folks direct their friendship love and compassion to james kennedy better known as radio a mentally slow high school kid played by cuba gooding jr the story takes place in the mid s in south carolina gooding does a nice job with the role too however like sean penn s role of a mentally challenged man in i am sam an hour and a half of a character like this is plenty after that the loudness of those guys gets tiresome to hear note it was interesting in one of the documentaries on this dvd to find out that in real life in took years for radio to make his transformation not months as shown in the film 
not much to it but a validation of small town values and the embracing of a mentally challenged young man into its heart i read some of the reviews and was surprised at some of the hostility it engendered i felt cuba gooding handled the part with dignity and respect unlike sean penn s drooling fool portrayal in i am sam the fact that this is based on a true story makes it all the more heartwarming sports are taken seriously in small town high school america and elsewhere i suspect and i felt the portrayal of these competitive students opening their hearts to one less fortunate rang true at least for me the coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and radio but rather came gently to the decision himself under radio s loving and open ways very well done to all out of debra winger we need more of you in pictures 
corniness warning as many fellow imdb users already know i m not a corny cheesy person if you don t want to read this kind of review then go to tell you the truth you re hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene spoilers one day i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts former child star last year in august the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly it was for radio the moment i saw the trailer i just had to see this movie on opening weekend when that weekend rolled along scary movie was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out good boy and radio i couldn t get a ticket and the following weeks i was busy with more important things about months later my friend rented radio he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room i ll tell you this now this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever when radio s mother died it just came out automatically the next day i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie cuba gooding jr stars as a mentally challenged man nick named radio ed harris co stars and this movie is directed by mike tollin based on a true story radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around he s got his own collection at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film one day radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on ed harris plays mr jones the football coach they meet and this is the life of radio throughout the whole movie radio and coach jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys the lowest lows and just seeing radio live his life you will laugh cry and live the life of radio with him this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if you re someone who just wants a great drama radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen radio will never be forgotten by me never as ed harris character said greatly near the end of the movie we re not teaching radio radio is teaching us my rating eliason a 
this is one of the best films i have ever seen how anyone can knock this movie just befuddles my imagination first of all gooding s and harris s performances were simply spectacular especially gooding that is the only way i can describe the acting spectacular you have to imagine how difficult it would be to play a character like that and pull it off then you see gooding and his performance was magical as for the plot since it was based on a true person it goes where the lives of the characters go for all the action buffs it might be a little slow but then it s not an action film i definitely give this movie a it deserves nothing less 
excuse me helloooooooooo cuba gooding jr should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film he was the film while the film may be lacking in some areas cuba was awesome and for me this is the best role that he has ever played the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up what a tragedy getting to see the real radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears you need a heart check if you liked simon birch and the mighty you ll love radio too i wish they made more movies like this radio is the real deal 
the fact that the movie is based on a true story contributes to a better and of course more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie the story is filled with unexpected twists which keeps the viewer at all times from figuring the ending out in one moment you think that something happens to coach jones or radio well it does but certainly not what you d expect the film becomes at no point boring or too sentimental and the acting performances by ed harris cuba gooding jr are some of their best in my opinion the ending puts a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right well i guess that was what michael tollin mike rich were trying to do first class movie esbj rn nordby birch denmark 
spoilers to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior to stay alive in real war to think off line analytically critically and not linear otherwise you will come to false conclusions that maj gray was dumb or unstable person truth is something completely different he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt o malley is that he wants her to kill him it was his way out he choose it he was not man who will retire if you ve never been on a first line you can t understand it he intentionally prepare his own suicide first he seduced mary jane than intentionally acted as a dumb than stageed argue shutting incident before witnesses to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial than gave her son a bullets to assure he could load her gun later came that night loaded her gun woke her up put her gun in her hands acted as he was attacking her after shot first time he raised knife and cried one kill so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot he also gave her a message with his last cry after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life this is the the only way for me to die as a man yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only prerogative war and army is not what you thought so far grow up finally and save your life till you can she left military life at the end she did understand him and he did not die in vain the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was col sam doran with help of lt tim macy macy didn t know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do he took photos of mary jane and maj gray by order of col sam doran who gave that order because maj gray asked him to do that after she refused to leave army what col doran asked her to do col doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder he knew she cant be found quilty instead of manslaughter there was some possibility to be found quilty with taken photos col doran also suppress argue shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury i have no doubt about outcome of that trial why col doran did that way because he will do anything maj gray ask him to do why because he saved his life on a battlefield why mary jane choose to go to trial because she was a person who have integrity a principles and that is why maj gray choose her it has to be somebody deserving somebody honourable keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour miroslav
gorgeous annie belle in her prime stars in this adventure sex movie she wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum she and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical asian paradise they have decided to keep an open sexual relationship which is played out on their journey to find a secret society tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony the scenery is gorgeous deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored the imagery is very similar to that of the movie black emanuelle it is rich and colorful recommended 
this movie reminded me of the live dramas of the s not like the recent failsafe which seemed more of a stunt than anything else but a true moral drama that is both engaging and thought provoking anne heche is more than credible as the army officer having an affair with her superior played by sam shepard and eric stoltz is wonderful as her lawyer defending her against the military establishment i found myself waiting for their affair to begin if only because they look so good together this movie is apparently based on a true story and it s a relief to be asked to think about real issues for a change directed by christopher menaul who also did the passion of ayn rand with stolz and the prime suspect series this is a movie with panache and style and is absolutely worth seeing 
certainly this film has the ring of truth about it as it purports to be based on actual occurrences at a marine base it deals with the attempted cover up by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine captain the man and woman had been lovers but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married he continued to stalk her going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time finally he broke into her home attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder the major you see was a decorated hero from vietnam and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base the captain too had made some enemies in her motor pool command rejecting some male advances in a very butch style there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama which the very capable cast gets across nicely the director and editor however seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view you re lucky if you know where you re at most of the time bear with them though it s a worthwhile story as the captain s court martial trial unfolds and it seems every man s hand is against her even her attorney at times the verdict well after all this is rather a suspense story so you ll have to see for yourself there is a kind of pacifist message folded into the film but forget about that sure war is hell but sometimes it can t be avoided we ll need those marines then even if they aren t always the best champions of fair play internally as kipling says in his poem tommy atkins it s tommy this and tommy that and tommy wait outside but it s room for mr atkins when the troopship s on the tide 
excellent cast story line performances totally believable i realize the close knit group that exemplifies the marine corps but this movie brought fear to my heart the marines let principles be damned it seems that this film was based on real life incidents it shows how difficult it is to go up against the establishment anne heche was utterly convincing sam shepard s portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering and eric stoltz as her attorney was so deft balancing his loyalty to the corp but also his loyalty to his client while high above on his tightrope he knew what his true course of action had to be but he was pulled apart by his immersion in the marine tradition loyalty to the corps above all else i sat riveted to the tv screen all in all i give this one a resounding out of 
the man who knew too much is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn t have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in marrakech it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens he s an agent that s looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader then he gets stabbed in a marrakeck market because of it being found out that he s a spy and proceeds to fall into stewart s arms dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day in a straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals the direction by alfred hitchcock is top notch the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute the scene in albert hall is a classic the original is so slow paced and drab i don t know how people can compare the two just watch the remake and you ll enjoy it i give the movie a out of 
unfortunately due to a sluggish start i can t say that this is one of hitch s best films it very excellent none the less the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back they both give excellent performances not surprising of course really however i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music the climax at the opera house was fantastic and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene also the use of doris day singing que sera sera was excellent especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film so this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look out of 
this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie bernard herrmann appears as himself near the climax the scenery and locations are great except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake which doesn t make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots i ve heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end i rated this movie out of 
some people say the pace of this film is a little slow but how is this different from any other hitchcock movie they all move very deliberately and as a point have spurts of suspense and brilliant montages injected through it this movie gives us just the right amount of comic relief which make the suspense scenes seem all the more suspenseful the albert hall scene is one of the best examples of pure cinema that exists in hitchcock s collection the best probably being almost all of rear window pure cinema for hitchcock meant a series of usually small pieces of film fit together without dialogue in order to tell the story visually this is of course the basic definition of the albert hall sequence as well as the shorter staircase sequence at the end of the picture not many slip ups by hitchcock here and the acting is superb especially by doris day in a rather surprising serious role 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock s black and white low budget original nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master s stable 
 s the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment to those who prefer the original i will say that that one is faster paced and wittier however even though the american version was heaven forbid a big budget blockbuster i believe it blows the british version out of the water i think this is one of hitchcock s best no small feat considering he made over films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to love james stewart america s favorite everyman for so many years does an excellent job playing the distressed father here he can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison doris day yes doris day despite all the criticisms directed toward her i think she makes the loving wife mother an extremely sympathetic person i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is soft spoken and gentle it doesn t mean she is docile and helpless i don t want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn t there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go and i loved que sera sera i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i ve ever heard and deservedly won its oscar it elevated the film to another level the albert hall sequence i don t think it was too long at all i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific crescendo and hitchcock s direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant and the assassin was truly frightening the ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again the last line in the film is highly amusing i don t think the film started out slowly hithcock was trying to get us to know and like the mckennas and he did a great job i wasn t a huge fan of the kid playing hank but i didn t have a problem with him since hank was ben and jo s kid i cared about him too it s not like he was a brat or anything i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues way to go hitch 
i can t believe this movie only scores this surely ranks up with the best of hitchcock s movies such as vertigo or marnie the only reason i can think of why the score is so low is that for the most part the man renounces violence and certainly won t get a diploma in sex and crime what it derives its tension from is not violence it s the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails today having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as mel gibson s ransom this seems normal but in the s where family was all in contemporary america the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot and this tension still works for me today yeah these guys are selfish ignorant bastards disturbing in how they act it s a deal for them and they want to be good businessmen disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera what makes the movie great however are the creative aspects the kinky ideas of hitchcock the outrageously disturbing scene in the church which brings it to the viewer s attention how alone how abandoned the protagonists are nobody caring nobody helping the people in the church just going home the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals which stresses the somewhat oriental flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad last not least the role of music in this movie music is the key principle here as spoiler the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti gong so hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second bang and then of course doris day singing que sera which became more famous than the movie itself she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy all in all a classic 
i finally saw laure and i have to say that i equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it what s great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast the story is non existent for sure but with these movies it doesn t really matter the pace in languid and the settings are exotic the film has a lot going for it unfortunately it also has a few things going against it the first thing is that the gorgeous annie belle and the handsome al cliver have no chemistry whatsoever because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability according to imdb al and annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie they sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen the other problem with laure is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous there s one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest i ve ever seen in any soft porn flick our young blonde couple are picked up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross dresser the pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter in mid air and al cliver is filming all of this with his mm camera i kid you not ridiculous we later see that mm footage being edited on a moviola while the footage rolls al and annie start making out this scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much watching the footage of the cross dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way the last thing i want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman while piloting a helicopter no less al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene i just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn t so silly speaking of drag another dull plot point in laure which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great orso maria guerrini and his two wives a married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting the two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex in fact orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film even when he s with annie belle this is another minor complaint about laure there s nudity but it s not as much as other films of the same era it just needed more skin to punch it up except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments laure is actually very watchable i love these kind of softcore films from the s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere not the crude stuff we see today p s make sure to watch emanuelle in egypt which stars annie al but also another famous screen couple laura gemser and gabriele tinti the music in that movie is also great 
less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo rear window or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest shot largely on location in morocco and london the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all american couple and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart a midwestern doctor is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out que sera sera written for this film in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock s greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole it s hitchcock light but recommended gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
one of master director alfred hitchcock s finer films this is the story of an american and his family james stewart doris day and their young son who are vacationing in north africa stewart is a doctor and day is a world famous singer they meet a frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus later one the frenchman whispers something into stewart s ear after he is attacked and dying the rest of the film is a puzzle as stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery the movie is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences you never really know what s going on in this film why people are appearing until the end and even then you re not sure the final scene takes place in albert hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for minutes with no dialog hitchcock had originally made this film in 
this film is the one which you fall in love with alfred hitchcock shall always remain over the top of any directors of his time the most influential aspects about his films are sheer simplicity gripping drama the another best thing about hitchcock s films is a definite gripping end any thing said about the man who knew too much is less the cinematography acting dialogs camera works are magnificent in this movie the song que sera sera at the end shall remain in our memories for life time the film is so enjoyable from start to end that we never know when it ends rarely would hitchcock include humor in his films this film has comic scenes which fits in to the movie this film is absolutely brilliant as good as vertigo 
am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the english film the english version has no suspense looks antique and very low budget and has unexceptional acting except for peter lorre the version besides having top production values shows james stewart as the perfect innocent american abroad and gives doris day her best role ever of particular note is the music the music of the american film is almost classic compare the albert hall sequences of both and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version even though it s basically the same music the only flaw in the film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better 
alfred hitchcock s remake of the man who who knew too much is usually not considered to be as good as the original but for me it is one of the best films ever i prefer it over vertigo and rear window like north by northwest it is the story of an average man who is unwillingly thrown into the world of international intrigue james stewart plays the father of a son who is kidnapped because he is mistaken for an international spy he will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protect his family while the original was good for it s time it is hard to watch by today s standards the remake has excellent production quality an endearing doris day and a really creepy villain don t bother to rent this one because you will want to see it over and over 
this isn t among my favorite hitchcock films though i must admit it s still pretty good among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart he always improves even the most mediocre material and the incredibly scary looking assassin who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him although it cost the studio a lot of money i didn t particularly care for doris day in the film she seemed to weep a lot and belts out que sera like a fullback yes i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner but this forever made me hate this song sorry the other complaint though minor i had about the movie was that it was a little too polished and hollywood esque the original version also done by hitchcock just seemed a lot grittier and seedier and this added to the scary ambiance 
if there s one good suspenseful film this is one of them james stewart puts on a dazzling performance as american dr ben mckenna who with his wife and son are in africa on tour they stumble on a murder scene and dr mckenna s son is kidnapped hours later before you can say fasten your seat belts dr mckenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it however other people know he can be dangerous dangerous to them that is and try to dispose of him eventually hank the son is found alive and well if you like suspenseful movies this is the one to watch my score 
james stewart plays dr ben mckenna who with his wife and son are tourists in an arabian city they get caught up in the middle of a murder scene the victim whispers something in dr mckenna s ear and he is told to do something later his son is kidnapped the kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew but the woman is a bit softer than the man the song que sera sera whatever we ll be we ll be is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie doris day play s stewart s wife and she sings the song mentioned above her performance is oscar worthy i m surprised she wasn t even nominated my score 
i have been getting into the hitchcock series very much lately i find myself always renting one of his movies when i m at blockbuster or hollywood video like i said before hollywood is loosing it s touch incredibly i needed a reminder that there are terrific films out there not to mention i want to be a film appreciator not a movie buff is there any better way to do that than with alfred hitchcock s movies the man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller starring alfred s favorite leading man james stuart and the woman who steals the show dorris day they play husband and wife who go on vacation with their son but when a spy tells james some information that could arrest another spy his son is kidnapped and held for ransom james seems to just doubt dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back but she makes a great comeback and just about ends up being the hero of the flick the acting again i would say that dorris was the one who outshined the whole cast james did a great job keeping up together these two made you sit down and never budge throughout the film i loved the little bit of comedy at the end that alfred added you ll see what i mean i would always highly recommend this film despite not being the best hitchcock film it s still a treasure 
i hate to admit it but i didn t find it to be one of hitchcock s best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchock s movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart the man who knows too much and his wife jo mckenna doris day are holidaying in morocco with their son hank christopher oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hank i found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock s other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believable in comparison to the great director s other works i believe this isn t as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film 
i ve been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early s i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i m not particularly interested in the dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical making sense no doubt only to it s franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile moodpiece 
ostensibly a story about the young child of jimmy stewart and doris day the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet they know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country during a performance at albert hall in london the movie is rich in hitchcockian incidents a friendly but opaque frenchman seems to grill the innocent stewart a doctor from indiana a little too intensely to be merely idly curious later the frenchman shows up in arab disguise a knife in his back and whispers some information about the murder plot to stewart stewart tells his wife doris day looking very saucy indeed but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son s life instead the couple try to track down the assassins buy them off and get their son back taking them from morocco where hitchcock has given us his usual tourist s eye view of the customs locations and food to london there is a hilarious wild goose chase involving a set to between stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop the staff are more concerned about guarding their half stuffed specimens than anything else and they shuffle around protectively holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish in the course of the scuffle stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish bill but is bitten on the hand by a stuffed tiger the action boosted along by bernard hermann s bumptious score the scene ends with stewart rushing out the door hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion s head gaping at the slammed door there is also a running gag well done about some visitors waiting around the couple s hotel room in london waiting for things to be explained there are two serious issues that are lightly touched on one is the relationship between stewart and day which is not as rosy as it ought to be considered as a bourgeois ideal she s been a stage musical star for some years and is internationally known and she s given it all up to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc that s understandable in say a nurse or a flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in her own right it isn t delved into but the edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version it reminds me a little of an exchange between joe dimaggio and his then wife marilyn monroe who had just returned from entertaining the troops in korea oh joe she gushed did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and cheer seventy thousand muttered joe former hero of the new york yankees the second problem is one of allegiance who is of greater social value one s own young son or an unknown ambassador do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability day is faced with this dilemma in its starkest form at the climax in the albert hall her solution opts for allegiance to political stability although her motives are problematic does she scream to save the ambassador s life or does she do so just to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her cf alec guiness falling on the detonator at the end of the bridge on the river kwai the photography is extremely good and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of london it s mid day and stewart is alone and determined but frightened too there are footsteps echoing on gulliver street from someone somewhere is he being followed is his life in danger and where the hell is everybody who lives on this street hitchcock pays such close attention to location details that we can make out the garden wall bonding of the bricks beside him the director had a rare disagreement with francois truffaut while being interviewed for truffaut s otherwise laudatory book truffaut argued that the earlier version of the man who knew too much lacked the depth of the later version hitchcock replied it seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience but finally agreed that the s version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional no argument there this is hitchcock pretty much near his zenith 
 the man who knew too much falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the s not a masterpiece of suspense by any means but an awful lot of fun nonetheless james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist so much of this movie reminded me of the chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play that i have to believe that film was inspired by this neither film is a big deal but both are easy to enjoy grade b 
dr ben mckenna james stewart and jo mckenna doris day travel to morocco for a holiday where they meet a mysterious man named louis bernard daniel g lin on a bus the next day this man is murdered but before he dies he tells ben a secret an assassination will take place in london the crooks kidnap the couple s son hank christopher olsen making sure ben won t reveal their plan to anybody alfred hitchcock s the man who knew too much is a very intense thriller the acting is superb as it always is in hitchcok s films james stewart is marvelous doris day is a delightful person and actress and she gets to show her singing talents as well the song que sera sera has an important part in the movie this movie is a movie of many classic scenes in the final scenes at the albert hall done without dialogue you can barely blink your eyes this movie is fifty years old now time hasn t decreased its power in any way 
hitchcock s remake of his film concerns about the known story of mckenna marriage james stewart doris day in the first version leslie banks edna best along with their years old son travelling through morocco during vacations in a bus they know a sympathetic french person daniel gelin in the old version pierre fresnay while they are in marrakech they also know a couple bernard miles and brenda de banzie and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing the dying whispers a political message then the child is abducted to ensure their silence and mckenna gets help to morocco s inspector buchanan ralph truman this is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they re forced into action is excellently played by james stewart and doris day this exciting film displays suspense intrigue tension and interesting drama well written by john michael hayes and charles bennett packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician innocent people become caught up in a cobweb intrigue and uncanny intelligent villains colorful and glimmer cinematography shot in morocco and london studios by cameraman robert burks though with excessive transparency for marrakech scenes lavish sets by henry bunstead hitchcock s usual and working until his recent death of course the highlights are the happenings of the famous royal albert hall of london assassination where a sneering killer reggie nalder tries to execute while composer bernard herrmann is conducting orchestra besides at the climax doris day singing que sera que sera meantime her son suffering risks the song won oscar for ray evans jay livingstone the story was ferociously reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining rating better than average hitchcock s enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it 
i put this second version of the man who knew too much to my top hitchcock movies together with frenzy it s probably the most argued film among the fans of hitchcock i consider it far better than say rebecca which has gained unreasonably much appreciation the film contains many ingenious scenes most of them have been mentioned in other reviews but that s something to be expected from hitchcock it takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen but that time is used for preparing the following happenings which are full of intriguing suspense if you can ignore the clumsy rear projections the only weakness of this film is the main villain played by bernard miles who is a rather flat and undeveloped character luckily there is a creepy assassin in the form of reggie nalder and hank the little boy isn t as irritating as most kids in old movies 
the movie which was directed by alfred hitchcock was brilliantly made it starts with a family of three a doctor james stewart his wife doris day who is a former stage singer and their young son my guess is about years old who are traveling through morroco for leisure on the bus the bump into a french government agent and they are a little too nice to him he is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought he wants to carry this information out to someone so he goes to the only person he even slightly knows james stewart the antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him his son would be killed stewart has to travel to london because that is where his son is and where the assasination that the agent told him about would be the movie is very suspenseful there are many twists and turns typical hitchcock movie also it has just the right amount of comic relief in addition to all of that it won an oscar for doris day s performance of que sara sara this movie is very good it is hard to find a problem about it i would certainly reccomend it to all hitchcock fans and all suspense fans i give this movie an a only because it is a little bit predictable 
 the man who knew too much is alfred hitchcock s own remake of his thriller about a married couple james stewart and doris day on vacation in morocco where they got caught up in a nightmare that include murder espionage assassinations and the worst of all kidnapping of their years old son the movie which hitchcock himself considered superior to the original is a great fun stewart and day have a good chemistry together the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense the inclusion of que sera sera proved to be a stroke of genius because rarely the song fits the content and plays such an important role in the movie like que sera sera did in the man who knew too much hitchcock also treats us to the live music playing from arthur benjamin storm cloud cantata for almost ten minutes while scene in london s royal albert hall where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted takes place and both the scene and the cantata are simply marvelous 
a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception it s a remake doris day is in it she sings hitchcock s second crack at the man who knew too much is his most under rated film and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right this is in more ways than one doris day s film not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against james stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his this is after all a film in which music is both motif and plot device what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation consider day s jo mckenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son this seems to be a mutual decision and she doesn t appear to be unhappy but look at the way stewart teases her in the horse drawn carriage over her concerns about louis bernard implying that she is jealous that bernard wasn t asking her any questions about her career this is clearly a recurrent joke between them she responds with a har de har har that denotes the familiarity of this gag suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement and that they both realise it after their son has been kidnapped stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news this is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career the potency of that voice is demonstrated in the ambrose chapel sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent at the albert hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive lungs that saves a man s life and in the embassy finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son by contrast all of stewart s masculine activity is counterproductive his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed thus depriving the police of potentially useful information it is only when his action is joined to his wife s voice in the rescue of hank from the embassy that he actually succeeds in doing something useful far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing que sera sera acts as the first musical device in the film foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the mckennas the future s not ours to see indeed it also neatly prepares the way for the finale in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall this lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually we see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say we don t need to the images say everything it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds the editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly there isn t a frame out of place anything that doesn t relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment the geography in which all this is playing out it builds slowly but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable when jo screams it isn t just a relief for her but for the audience the ambrose chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick in the mud nonconformist church the embassy sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that preceded it on first viewing but second time around actually seems more effective with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background reminiscent of the music as ambient noise in rear window the score as a whole is subtle allowing the music from on screen sources to be foregrounded effectively bernard miles is a low key villain a little banal but with a dry wit he s outshone by brenda de banzie as his wife who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin her stance is pure gangster s moll belying the middle england exterior but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards hank stewart is excellent although if hitchcock really did always cast him as everyman as the director s daughter seems to think then it confirms that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in rope a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive necrophiliac in vertigo day is nothing short of phenomenal just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped she never overdoes anything but neither does she sell it short this is one of hitchcock s most emotionally effective films he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the mckennas they feel the most fully human of all his central characters 
many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of the man who knew too much which i have not had the opportunity to view by itself the version is a very well done film the run of mid to late fifties hitchcock films including rear window dial m for murder vertigo and to catch a thief as well as this film is one of my favorite periods in his career in the man who knew too much jimmy stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always doris day is very believable in the role of an atypical hitchcock blond i thought there was nothing fake about her performance her character may not have been written as strongly as the original but she s definitely not reduced to the role of a passive yes dear pretty thing on jimmy stewart s arm there were some really clever lines written for hank the couple s son who later gets kidnapped in the opening scene on the bus it s too bad christopher olsen read them so woodenly it s rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the s though most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent though most notably the assassin played by reggie nalder some little touches that make this film undeniably hitchcockian the use of non english dialog especially french something hitch did on a much larger scale in to catch a thief the use of foreboding arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears stewart and day talking to each other in the church singing their words to the tune of the hymn the albert hall scene specifically showing the musicians and the assassin s accomplice following the score building up tension as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready and finally the assassin s gun as it appears from behind the curtain it moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically an effect hitch used at the end of spellbound also all in all the man who knew too much is a fun film to watch it s not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films vertigo strangers on a train but all the same it is one of my top five hitchcock masterpieces 
alfred hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own british film the man who knew too much this take on the same story is much lighter than the previous one mr hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next thus keeping a standard in his work robert burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and george tomasini s editing shows his talent ultimately bernard herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent royal albert hall in london at the climax of the picture james stewart was an actor that worked well with mr hitchcock in this version he plays a doctor from indiana on vacation with his wife and son when we meet him they are on their way to marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins his wife is the lovely doris day at her best she had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother the film has some good supporting cast brenda debanzie bernard miles daniel gelin alan mowbray among others do a great job in portraying their characters although this is a light hitchcock one can t dismiss it as a failure the man who knew too much is a change of pace for hitchcock s fans

many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message thus confusing the hero not to mention the audience dr ben mckenna james stewart and his wife jo a former musical star doris day are vacationing in morocco with their son hank christopher olsen when they meet mr and mrs drayton a british couple brenda de banzie and bernard miles they are also befriended by a charming frenchman louis bernard daniel gelin who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute the mackennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the draytons when they spot louis bernard the next day in the market place they are caught in an assassination intrigue while they are wandering in the local market the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers dr mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms a knife sticking out of his back gulping his last breath the dying man mutters some words and collapses dr mckenna is completely taken aback when the arab s hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise mckenna is left knowing too little but as far as the assassins are concerned too much to prevent dr mckenna from revealing what he knows the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnapping how to get the little boy back safely the subplot about the assassination is just the setup the film is a breathless escapade the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor accidentally involved in political intrigue his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly human a person we could easily identify with it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film by the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth etting s biopic love me or leave me but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents the casting of character actor reggie malder as the assassin is brilliant the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil 
alfred hitchcock s more assured telling of a film he made twenty one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur and although it certainly isn t a bad film he does appear to be right that being said this remake although definitely better still isn t among hitchcock s best work that s certainly not to say that it isn t good it s just more than a little overindulgent and that drags it down hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out and these are parts of the film that aren t entirely relevant to the plot which can become annoying some of these dragged out sequences such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in but for every restaurant scene there s an opera sequence and it s the latter that make the film worse the plot follows a middle aged doctor and his wife that go to morocco for a holiday with their young son while there they meet a french man on the bus and another middle aged couple in a restaurant however things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back shortly after whispering something to the doctor the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple s son is kidnapped which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it and it manages to hold this all the way through in fact i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made like most of hitchcock s films this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused there is also more than a little humour in the movie which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on and actually works quite well the original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre this film doesn t benefit from his presence unfortunately but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart and doris day james stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the greatest actor of all time crown his collaborations with hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him and this one is no different although his best performance remains the one in mr smith goes to washington stewart conveys all the courage conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly in fact that s one of the best things about this film you are really able to feel for the couple s loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling doris day on the other hand is a rather strange casting choice for this movie she s definitely a good actress but she s more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little as i ve mentioned this is not hitchcock s best film but there s much to enjoy about it and although i d recommend many hitchcock films before recommending this one i ll definitely give it two thumbs up as well 
the original the man who knew too much brought alfred hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the united kingdom of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen the original film was shot inside a studio for whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big hollywood studio behind him paramount decided to see what the man who knew too much would be like with a lavish budget this is shot on location in marrakesh and london and has two big international names for box office this was james stewart s third of four hitchcock films and his only teaming with doris day and her only hitchcock film i do wonder why hitchcock never used doris again at first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that hitchcock favored possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication hitchcock also wanted in his blondes doris does some of her best acting ever in the man who knew too much her best scene is when her doctor husband james stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an english couple who befriended them in morocco stewart and day play off each other beautifully in that scene but doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once day and stewart are on vacation with their son christopher olsen in morocco and they make the acquaintance of frenchman daniel gelin and the aforementioned english couple bernard miles and brenda dabanzie gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in marrakesh and whispers some dying words to stewart about an assassination to take place in albert hall in london their child is snatched in order to insure their silence for the only time i can think of a hit song came out of a hitchcock film doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother the song was que sera sera and i remember it well at the age of you couldn t go anywhere without hearing it in it even competed with the fast rising elvis presley that year que sera sera won the academy award for best song beating out such titles as true love from high society and the title song from around the world in days it became doris day s theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back in fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax instead of doing it with mirrors hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real albert hall and like another reviewer said it s not directed it s choreographed you ll be hanging on your seats during that moment this was remake well worth doing 
anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one great story of an aspiring actor and the pressures he must deal with both personally and professionally in order to make it to the big time lou myers as half step wilson provides many hilarious moments 
many funny scenes about the people that you don t normally pay attention to in a movie and what they have to do to get work and what happens once they do lou myers was very funny as half step wilson any guy that has a tight group of friends can relate to many of the non movie related scenes scattered throughout the movie 
fun story of a regular guy with big dreams this low budget film really hits home showing what it is like trying to become an acting success great performances by lou myers and brian s neighbor alex i giggled alot and even cried a little 
i thought this was a really cute movie inspiring makes me want to try acting i love kelly ripa and it s nice that i can watch this in addition to all my children i ve already watched it times of course i also loved seeing joe barbara especially since another world went off the air 
this movie was so heart warming a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there dreams never give up hurray for the stand in 
a superman cartoon a huge shipment of gold is being sent across country by train using ultra modern techniques a sophisticated gang of hooded thieves try to waylay the gold with intrepid reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board it s superman to the rescue but now that it s become a runaway train can even he stop the billion dollar limited this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max fleischer produced for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fast moving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts 
millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury traveling along is lois lane to report on it along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in she beats the thieves off the train at one point using a gun but the train starts to careen out of control lois can t stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold good thing superman is on the way fast exciting non stop action probably one of the best of all the cartoons just great 
there is a lot to like in this film despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes i for one was sure it was the teacher in fact that would have been more probable plot wise because the idea of the best friend s boy friend kind of came out of nowhere i guess the point of that is that rape is omnipresent you never know who it is going to be ms beller is luminous as always yet see kb discussion board for my qualification of this statement like all preachy films the plot lasts minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip blythe danner as the mom is in the role she was born to play the fretting over protective mom some good s scenes for s fans the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark stained beams barrels oak and cork a must for beller fans and highly recommended for fans of s high school melodrama or s kitsch in general 
when one watches the animated superman shorts of the s the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter threatening metropolis with some evil invention death rays mechanical monsters electric earthquake magnetic telescope what have you this one is refreshingly different the bad ones drive around in a car shooting and bombing but the center of action is the gold train on which lois lane travels as the only press reporter it seems train movies have their own typical ingredients from the great train robbery on and quite some are featured here decoupling cars in motion running on the roofs taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back fighting with the engineer a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track the fall of people or the whole train from a high bridge it s all in the few minutes of this lovely piece but it wouldn t be a superman film if he didn t do some incredible feats involving balancing and high precision placement to ultimately win the day if you re a fan of train movies don t miss this it s in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive org 
while all of the fleischer famous studios superman cartoons are excellent billion dollar limited the third in the series is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation plot and pacing why it wasn t even nominated for an oscar as best animated short for incredibly enough only the first one was in inexplicable here lois lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u s mint masked gangsters in their super powered for car take off after the train determined to get that gold without giving too much away what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience with truth justice and superman triumphant at the end as they did in all the fleischer famous superman cartoons clayton bud collyer and joan alexander who played clark kent superman and lois lane on radio have the voice work honors here and fleischer perennial jack mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys as well 
i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip although it started out slowly i found that the realism in depicting the ship the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching the protagonist was destined to be challenged grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it i was not disappointed the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between often in the same scene the same breath there was a wealth of emotional overlaying interaction and expression relentless and compelling to observe the movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next edmund talbot is a complex character the likes of which we don t see often we may know where the captain stands or mr prettiman but they are older men set in their ways talbot was young and arrogant still learning testing himself and being tested he struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched that grew with each hard taught experience i appreciate the excellent characterization it s too rare in movies and television 
meticulously constructed and perfectly played to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age based on william golding s trilogy these three minute films chronicle the journey towards both australia and experience of youthful aristocrat edmund talbot benedict cumberbatch aboard an aging man o war in the early th century as he heads for a government position down under among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing his passage are a tempestuous bullying captain jared harris a politically radical philosopher sam neill a canny st lieutenant who s worked his way up from the bottom jamie sives and fleetingly the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman joanne page whose ship literally passes in the night quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy director david attwood and screenwriters tony basgallop and leigh jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the napoleonic era shipboard life is one brutal monotonous round of seasickness squalor and danger after another and as edmund becomes entangled in the loves hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life s hardships man s inhumanities and his noblest sentiments those who enjoyed master and commander the far side of the world or patrick o brian s series of novels on which it was based will love this for everyone else it s a whole new world to discover 
i saw the second part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the th century golding s book must be responsible for some of the superb dialogue but everything else was good too i especially liked the way they created the period and feeling of being on the ship so well for me this had a feeling of completeness about it which i know i won t be able to convey in words perhaps it was the way they mixed in technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteen hundreds to the story without messing it up benedict cumberbatch was excellent as was the rest of the cast it s not often a mini series sends me to the zone but this one did 
the three part series ended last night on pbs which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience the richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points it seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of georgian england jane austen s filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like tolstoy or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s forester or patrick o brian sea saga the universality of basic human condition lies at its center narrator talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict cumberbatch surely not even dickens could beat that one alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as well the most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a man of war en route to australia in the early s is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming this is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances 
this is the best d experience disney has at their themeparks this is certainly better than their original s acid trip film that was in it s place is leagues better than honey i shrunk the audience and far more fun barely squeaks by the muppetvision d movie at disney mgm and can even beat the original d movie experience captain eo this film relives some of disney s greatest musical hits from aladdin the little mermaid and others and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show this is a totally kid friendly movie too unlike honey and has more effects than the spectacular muppetvision 
it s not a movie but an experience not the usual eye candy i thought it would be too many things are happening at once your senses almost couldn t handle it a product of cutting edge technology we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our d glasses on and off to decipher the magic the music is great it s a concert the disney characters are in it and you get to be part of their world it s funny it s magical it s exciting i know this is beginning to sound like an advertisement but it really is that awesome beats christmas in bringing out the kid in you this attraction alone already makes going to disney all worth it 
i m not a disney fan at all but i happen to be in orlando for a friend s wedding so my traveling partner and i went to disney for a few days i haven t seen a good d effect in well ever so i usually try to stay away from these presentations the d effect in this was so good i m a grown man of and even i wanted to try and reach out and touch it s that good word of advice at the end look to the back of the theater on the wall put it like this the first time i saw it the effect wasn t working so i told my friend it would have been nice if my friend said that s exactly what happens it s not working for some reason it s an awesome show you will not be disappointed 
i recently visited the magic kingdom as an adult with my mom her best friend and my adult sister disney world is often mistakenly perceived as a place for just children but when you see quality shows like mickey s philharmagic you realize that the magic of disney is for everyone it was such a great show that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again and then a third time it was absolutely breathtaking i would encourage anyone who goes to disney world to check out this show which is not just a show but a world wind fun filled ride with donald as he once again lets his temper get him in trouble 
 are you in the house alone belongs to the pre cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows it is well made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations kathleen beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but beller is really scared tony bill and blythe danner play beller s parents ellen travolta john s sister is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid it s a competent chiller with a still relevant social message beller is lovely if you are or older you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters blythe danner who i usually don t like gives a truly moving performance nice little film 
this program was on for a brief period when i was a kid i remember watching it whilst eating fish and chips riding on the back of the tron hype this series was much in the style of streethawk manimal and the like except more computery there was a geeky kid who s computer somehow created this guy automan he d go around solving crimes and the lot all i really remember was his fancy car and the little flashy cursor thing that used to draw the car and help him out generally when i mention it to anyone they can remember very little too was it real or maybe a dream 
this movie is amazing you will never laugh harder it s a target no i think it s yes it s a boob this movie gets funnier by the second like when jackie chan s character finally dies in his final fight scene this movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha congrats if you buy or rent this you ll never return it in my opinion i didn t and i haven t found it in a store since i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung fu action flicks if you re looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value good or even mediocre acting and good special effects this is not that movie if you re looking for laughs and timeless wonderment pick this up for a dollar and you ll probably never let it go with friends popcorn and drinks it s the perfect evening 
the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john woo s masterful direction coupled with kat s superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james tien and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can t help but love to hate tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad it s a role reversal the likes of which i don t think i ve ever seen before tien normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache i didn t even recognize him at first sammo s goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent 
the hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is a vastly underrated early work by director john woo the film stars dorian tan tan tao liang and features jackie chan sammo hung and james tien in significant supporting roles many people believe or have been lead to believe by deceptive advertising that this is a jackie chan film this is not a jackie chan film dorian tan is the star but jackie gives one of his best most serious early performances the hand of death is about a shaolin disciple named yunfei tan who is sent on a mission to assassinate a shaolin traitor named shih xiaofeng tien and protect a revolutionary named zhang yi woo along his journey yunfei meets up with a young woodcutter named tan chan and a disgraced sword fighter chang chung known as the wanderer both men have suffered at the hands of shih and want to take revenge the three team up to defeat shih and his eight bodyguards and escort the revolutionary to safety the martial arts action is above average under the direction of sammo hung dorian tan uses his trademark high kicks very effectively as the northern eighteen styles kicks along with some southern five styles boxing sammo hung and jackie chan provide excellent martial arts performances as well james tien is not the greatest martial artist on the jade screen but does an acceptable job some of the early fights are a bit slow and seem over choreographed but the final showdowns featuring chan tan and hung are very good director john woo provides plenty of interesting character development in the film which is refreshing the cinematography by leung wing kat is very stylish unique and beautiful for a kung fu film of this era joseph koo s music a combination of soft flutes and s shaft style orchestral pieces is kung fu cinema at its best hand of death is not jackie and sammo s usual kung fu comedy hand of death is a serious straightforward revenge driven story hand of death aka countdown in kung fu is an underrated classic in the old school kung fu genre the film is one of the best artistically of its time and a preview of the great things to come from jackie chan and sammo hung hung s great choreography is put on display here before his directorial debut and chan s early charisma and talent can be clearly seen hand of death is a solid stylish old school kung fu film and a brilliant early work of the legendary john woo kung fu genre rating wanderer to tan referring to his new weapon the little eagle wing god lance tan just a knickknack 
this movie is an evolutionary piece from terminator to robocop stan winston did the spfx in this film a scientist working in a sinister robotics company with a really creepy boss they always are gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an indestructible robot body the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg man regains consciousness and wreaks havoc while trying to communicate with his wife played by the gorgeous back then in terri austin he tries to reconnect with his old life like in that scene in robocop the rest of this movie is about breaking things while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from recapturing him for some ill defined turn humans into cyborgs project this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot gort does except for the frankenstein suite designed by stan winston this movie s production values are typically canadian sleazy pam grier stars in this film as an hired killer commando a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the s as for a sci fi horror b movie out of stars this film ranks about a 
the combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the vindicator one of the most important sci fi films of recent years for some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by relagating to a bargain bin is beyond me i have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire forget terminator robocop aliens and other films that blaintly ripped off this masterpiece the vindicator is an unstoppable force 
looks as if the robocop writer has been wholesale looting the vindicator this is a very solid horror action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in cruel experiment anyone who have seen robocop knows the story watch out for pam grier as a bitchy and darn good looking assassin this highly effective violent and bloody horror movie may not be to everyones liking but this canadian outing is well worth seeking out for anyone who is fan of the genre 
as a fan of robocop i always loved this movie i seen it when it first came out and finally i bought it on dvd from brazil it was never released in the us on dvd i like the film but like everything else in this world everyone has their opinion love it or hate it no matter what a movie does someone will always say why didn t they do it another way in other words you cant please everyone if you love robocop you will love this film to me its so unique thats its not cheesy or silly like a lot of lower budget movies this film always kept me interested i can see a few scenes that robocop borrowed from here but tell me what movies don t do that a lot of films use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them around fun film

ascending to power in hitler and his national socialist german workers party which of course we all know as the nazis tightened their grip on the country more and more as the time went by early in their rough shod trampling of the german people they called any and all artists newspaper men and film makers into their nazi hq in order that the may be informed of just what the newly declared third reich aka empire expected of them when the master director from the german cinema s silent impressionist and expressionist era mr fritz lang was called in to meet with herr goebels he listened attentively and said nothing immediately after leaving the minister of propaganda s office herr lang went directly to the train station and took a passenger directly to paris not even going back to his residence fritz lang did not return to germany at least not until many years later he remained in france eventually immigrating to the united states of america mr lang went right to work in america creating a variety of most enjoyable solid and substantially literate upper echelon movies for many a year included in this sm rg sbord of titles is today s lucky subject western union th century fox typically a film about the old west and pioneer days needed both quality as well as quantity of cast western union qualified on both requisites we are treated to a fine array of starring talent as well as a supporting cast which makes just about every minute and each scene a delight to our senses heading up the playbill are robert young randolph scott dean jagger and virginia gilmore others prominently displayed are folks like john carradine playing not a vampire or other scary guy but a physician george slim summerville veteran character actor silent film veteran and graduate of mack sennett s keystone comedies chill wills always dependable supporting player and former singer in the avalon boys and burly bad guy barton maclane added to this mix we have names like russell hicks victor killian minor watson george chandler addison richards irving bacon james flavin francis ford frank mcgrath and kermit maynard ken maynard s bro prominent in those american indians featured are chief big tree chief thundercloud and mr jay silverheels also featured is that one great representative of the aboriginal peoples of north america is that great singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man the louisiana native iron eyes cody born espera decorti of sicilian immigrant parents the filming of the fine outdoor scenes was done on location in arizona and utah and rendered in the highest grade of technigolour available there is no monument valley but then that s the province of mr john ford in some respects this film is a far more amazing accomplishment than we might think for it took a sort of pulp magazine story adapted it to the tastes and idioms of the pre war america of the late thirties and early forties all of this being done by a german born director who was only had been in hollywood and america for the shortest length of time in its final analysis western union while it may not be the most historically accurate example of the western genre we just don t care it scores in all of the necessary categories needed for a great night at the movies so who really cares about little details such as accuracy we give mr lang and th century fox a rating of note we just saw a special on pbs station wttw here in chicago that was all about all of the film actors directors and other artisans whom the nazi rise to power caused to take refuge in america and hollywood it seems that movie folks and scientists were the biggest export for germany at this particular time being that the scientists who built the atomic bomb as well as the future nasa people came from europe at this time poodle schnitz 
okay i love this movie i watched it over and over again it is so hard to tell who the attacker is you keep thinking it s one person then another then back to the first person then another person it is so suspense full you want to fast forward your tv to the end to see who it is summary gail osborne is raped and left at her home she is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped it goes from her meeting her steady boyfriend to her teacher who takes a liking to her to her ex boyfriend all different stories all suspects but who did it i love the acting they have a lot of great talent in here the suspense is wonderful and the settings are superb if it comes on tv watch it stars 
this is a very very odd film one that is so odd it s best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self importance additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head oddly this is only half way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor s novels one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them see this weird film it s amazingly compelling and not like anything i ve ever seen before 
this western was set in and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by western union while nice guy dean jagger sporting lots of hair did his best to get this done there was a bad guy just waiting to undo this for his own selfish reasons so it s up to either randolph scott or robert young to save the day this is certainly one of the better s westerns i have seen and it nearly garnered an it was that good however for the life of me i have no idea why fritz lang was assigned to direct this film after all he knew nothing about westerns his forte was drama and i guess this movie is a drama of sorts just set in the old west strange yes but it seemed to work out okay though i wonder how this great german director felt about being given this job as for the rest of the film it s exceptional with vivid color great location shooting and very good acting as usual randolph scott put in another relaxed and realistic performance i was surprised though with robert young being also cast in the film but it was a good casting decision he was supposed to be a harvard educated easterner when i saw barton maclane was also in the film i pretty much assumed he d be the baddie and my thoughts were well founded since he made a career out of playing jerks as for the script it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part but the final showdown between scott and barton maclane was a lot better than i d hoped making this movie ending on a very high note 
western union tells in melodramatic fashion the stringing of telegraph lines between two points out west siblings dean jagger and virginia gilmore work for western union and randolph scott and robert young work for the creightons indians and some bad white guys get in the way but nothing can stop america s progress this sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first rate musical score and vibrant color photography scott is a bank robber looking to mend his ways and both he and engineer young vie for the attention of the perky gilmore lots of great character actors help keep the large production moving forward 
this is a sort of hidden gem it has little to no promotion no fanfare no classic status and it deserves all of the above one of the great directors of cinema fritz lang has created a real gem in this excellent western a fine cast led by randolph scott in probably one of his greatest performances the always sturdy dean jagger robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors chill wills slim summerville john carradine barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country it has tense drama sprinklings of humor and great effects it s reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it at very least this is a damned good western 
here s another of the s westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc because although it may be flawed historically it is extremely entertaining and well acted plus it s got randolph scott my favorite actor second only to gary cooper well ok fourth behind coop charlton heston and gregory peck but the film itself to me anyway is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before well acted and flows very well i bet i ve seen it or times and enjoy each viewing more than the one before i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd see it if you haven t i guarantee you ll like it 
lang does hawks as well as hawks does in the first part of this extraordinary western before settling down into typical deterministic dark and guilt haunted lang for the finale this is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly but at the same time very subtly vance shaw randolph scott is on horseback and being pursued we know not why he stumbles on wounded edward creighton dean jagger and decides to take his gun and horse but discovering that creighton is in a bad way decides to fix him up first this is conveyed mostly through facial expressions and very brief clipped dialog in minutes we know that shaw is an outlaw but basically a good guy shaw ends up helping creighton on his way to civilization then disappears cut to a few weeks or months later with creighton on the mend and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire going west from omaha he hires shaw as a scout who tries to leave when he finds out that creighton is in charge but creighton wants him anyway repaying a debt and sensing something quality also hired is a tenderfoot son of a benefactor of the project but atypically the easterner richard blake robert young is quite competent as he shows right away in an amusing but exciting bronco busting sequence both of the hires vie for creighton s sister sue virginia gilmore who again not typically seems quite as able to take care of herself as any man the camaraderie between the three men the comedic elements involving an unwilling cook and various rough and tumble types and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of howard hawks red river or only angels have wings than most lang but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it doesn t matter and doesn t alter our pleasure if it does perhaps change our expectations as the more usual langian themes of the haunted past dark secrets and the immense pull of the easier destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the film shaw s old pals come back to haunt him as the the wagon train and its wires move westward attacks mount on the crew and shaw has to wrestle with what if anything he is to tell creighton about his tortured relationship with jack slade barton maclane leader of the outlaws beautifully shot in early technicolor and moving fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations this is for my money easily lang s best western and one of his very best films conveying as potently as any of his films the tragic inability of men to escape their pasts and build a new future scott is as good as i ve seen him showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of actors can do in a paragraph of dialog and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine the inevitable showdown between shaw s past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary and a surprise even for a longtime lang devotee such as myself and even in it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside you can get a shave you can feel like a new man but you can t really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back genius 
one of the best western movies ever made unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserved the storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best i give it a double a randolph scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast the ending was one of the best of any western made 
if western union isn t exactly the real story of the construction of the transcontinental telegraph it certainly does capture the spirit and dedication of the people involved with the project dean jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he s thrown from a horse and sustains some fractured ribs an outlaw on the run randolph scott finds jagger and is ready to steal his horse but changes his mind and brings jagger to help later on he s hired by western union and works for jagger jagger also hires a young easterner played by robert young who s an engineer young is doing one of his few loan out films away from mgm for th century fox both young and scott become friends but rivals for jagger s sister virginia gilmore western union has plenty of action enough to satisfy any western fans the telegraph crew has to deal with outlaws indians and your garden variety labor troubles slim summerville as the timid cook and victor killian as the frontier character assigned to guard him have some of the funniest scenes they both provide some good comic relief fritz lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly along western union is solid western entertainment 
i first saw this film in the theater way back in the s when i was a kid and always remembered the ending there is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed something just resonates with them this is one of those films and i agree with another reviewer who said fritz lang should have directed more westerns to add to it i have always liked randolph scott and robert young in fact robert young stars in what i consider my favorite movie if i have to name just one not an easy thing to do that film is northwest passage it led me to the superb historical novels of kenneth roberts western union likewise led me to reading zane grey s novel which in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where i like the movie better than the novel not that grey s novel is a bad one i just like the movie story better the movie in no way resembles the novel it is a completely different tale one of the biggest departures from a book i have seen i can t add much to the other reviews except to say i agree with many of them i too wish it would be released on dvd whatever happened to randolph scott happened to the best of me 
fritz lang directed two great westerns western union and the return of frank james the frank james movie equals jesse james western union is one of randolph scott s great westerns i have never seen robert young in a western before he is terrific as the telegraph employee this is the only movie i can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west it is a high geared story about the telegraph in the west a triangle love story and about loyalty the supporting cast is superb dean jagger who made a few westerns plays the telegraph manager virginia gilmore who plays mr jagger s sister is the love interest in the movie ms gilmore had a short career in movies she quit films in and became a drama coach she is primarily known as the first mrs yul brynner it is great to see slim summerville in a movie with mr scott again they were in two other great movies rebecca of sunnybrook farm and jesse james 
hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving jagger s life jagger works for western union a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and bandits scott is in charge of the men and young is a telegraph expert who can t shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can t tell anyone it s a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns 
doe eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie the film then flashbacks to the few days before the rape as beller is harassed by a stranger beller and scott colomby and her best friend robin mattson and dennis quaid are double dating early on beller s anxious parents laid back tony bill and shrill blythe danner wait at home wringing hands and so on right away the s makes its dated entrance as the young couples discuss the romance and love in three days of the condor beller an amateur photographer begins getting threatening notes stuffed in her locker at school the film makers wisely give us a whole slew of suspects beller s new boyfriend mattson s boyfriend beller s dad beller s ex boyfriend and what about that overly friendly photography class teacher who wants beller to be a little more sexy in her self portraits i knew who the rapist was because the worldvision video company video box has a picture of the attack on the back cover destroying any suspense in that regard without giving away who the attacker is beller begins getting harassing phone calls and is eventually raped the movie then heads south as she makes like nancy drew and secretly sets up a time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student finally the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration from beller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in that day and age the suspense here is very real without going over the top into scary movie stuff beller is very good and watch for her and mattson s scene in an abandoned theater both do great jobs the film is full of familiar faces including ellen travolta in a small role and everyone is professional this was made in and it shows i am sure no one had any idea that this would be reviewed in by an overcritical horror movie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in the morning but some of the attitudes here are embarassing the teacher who tells beller to be sexy is never made to explain what exactly he had in mind nowadays if any high school teacher said that then that would have been a made for tv movie on its own after beller is raped the rapist is still a part of her life as warrants are issued blah blah blah there may not be a case because beller is not a virgin and cannot prove she was raped by whom she said many of these problems have been addressed with modern technology and policing efforts but this film obviously knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate rape is an act of violence that has not gone away but efforts today to catch the attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago the problem is the anti rape angle feels tacked on like an afterthought before that we have a tight little suspenser that has real honest to god characterization after the rape everything changes filmwise and not for the better i remember beller from the s and s and who could forget her revealing role in the betsy but she has not done anything in almost ten years this is a shame since she was very good way back then i will recommend are you in the house alone based on the acting alone with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of the film if you want to relive s made for tv high school life this is your cup of tab this is unrated but contains physical violence some sexual violence and some adult situations 
while escaping from a heist of a bank the outlaw vance shaw randolph scott helps edward creighton dean jagger the chief engineer of the western union that is surveying the wild west and had had an accident with a horse in vance regenerates and is hired to work for the western union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from omaha to salt lake city vance and the engineer from harvard richard blake robert young flirt with the gorgeous edward s sister sue creighton virginia gilmore and she chooses vance however his past haunts him when the outlaw jack slade barton maclane steals the western union cattle disguised of indians western union is a good but predictable western directed by fritz lang the story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for installing the telegraph through the west facing thieves and indians the entertaining story has action drama romance and funny situations but with the exception of the identity of jack slade there is no surprise in the story randolph scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast my vote is seven title brazil os conquistadores the conquerors 
i doubt if the real story of the development of western union would ever have gained a real audience instead of talking about the building of the telegraph system out west it was the story of board rooms dominated by one of the most interesting and disliked of the great robber barons jay gould gould picked up the struggling company and turned it into a communication giant and part of his attempt at a national railway system to rival vanderbilt s but this while interesting is not as exciting as the story of the laying of the telegraph lines themselves at least that is how audiences would see it jay gould died in had he lived into the modern era and invested in hollywood he probably would have agreed to that assessment too the film deals with how the laying of the telegraph system is endangered by indians spurred on by one jack slade barton maclane slade a desperado is not happy with the development of a communication system that will certainly put a crimp in his abilities to evade the police in the territories he is confronted by the man in charge of the laying of the telegraph wires edward creighton dean jagger creighton s associate richard blake robert young and a quasi lawman vance shaw randolph scott who is slade s brother blake an easterner with little understanding of the west is romancing creighton s sister sue virginia gilmore but finds it hard to get used to his new surroundings but he does become a close friend of shaw especially in trying to confront slade slade was a real western criminal by the way and the subject of a section of mark twain s roughing it he was hanged in the s but he did not have any involvement in stirring up indians against railroads or telegraph companies however maclane makes him a memorably evil and totally vicious type his killing of one of the major characters is done suddenly and from behind and he views the corpse as though he has just got rid of an annoyance but lang is responsible for that as well as other touches look at the sequence with chill wills where he is on a telegraph pole repairing it he spits tobacco juice several times while talking to young who gets a little splattered then there is an indian attack which we watch from the ground level at the conclusion young suddenly gets splattered again but it s not brown but red that covers him he looks up at the pole s top and there is wills with an indian arrow through him it is an exciting film to watch and well worth catching 
 western union is something of a forgotten classic western perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on dvd in the united states however all is not lost as it has now appeared on region in england this being a blessing in some ways is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union telegraph company is without a region release it beggars belief it simply doesn t make sense produced by fox in western union was directed by fritz lang this was only the second occasion the great german director undertook to direct a western he had done an excellent job the year before with fox s the return of frank james and would have only one more western outing in with the splendid rancho notorious lang was no ford or hawks but with western union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by robert young randolph scott and dean jagger the female lead is taken by virginia gilmore who really has little to do in the picture an actress who never made anything of her career her presence here is merely cosmetic it is curious that robert young has top billing over scott it is clearly scott s picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film s terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains young doesn t have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western he just looks plain silly going up against barton mclane in a gunfight an actor who never really distinguished himself except perhaps with crossfire young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tv s marcus welby md in the seventies he died in at the age of western union recounts the connection by telegraph wire of omaha and salt lake city scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from marauding sioux and to also take on mclane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with scott for the affections of miss gilmore some comic relief is provided by and irritatingly so some would say by slim summerville and john carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor altogether though a spanking good western albeit on region but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with my only crib is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics ugh footnote interestingly the associate producer on western union was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a partnership that would produce some of scott s finest westerns in the fifties 
i saw this years ago and it s entertaining but not profound the basic story is of a young man who dreams of midian though he s not sure where it is or even if it really exists spoilers follow he finally visits it gets transformed to a nightbreed creature by being bitten by another one then he has to help the other members of the nightbreed because they re being attacked by canadians save for the accents they all act like good ol boys not much in tune with the canadian psyche eh someone observed for monsters or nightbreed substitute jews and for the canadians humans substitute nazis and you re supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans well maybe one major objection i had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather ramshackle and frankly dirty this must be a convention for movies with underground settlements one would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of decor the storyline is a tad thin but that s to introduce characters but it s entertaining enough for a repeat view 
featuring some amazing and wonderful characters a new mythology superbly designed and executed sets nightbreed is a great film sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries none the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre a sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting another idea would be the foundation of the new midian perhaps in texas somewhere or the swamps of lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus 
nightbreed blew my mind the first time i saw it and it s held up quite well over the years the sets and monster effects work are some of the best i ve ever seen nobody i know seems to have seen this film which i believe tanked at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties it plays like a dark horrific fairy tale and is a lot deeper then you d think with a strong message against bigotry presented by a rich mystical past that clive barker created what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note that we ll probably never see my only minor gripe is that craig sheffer is only a passable actor at best and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part just a minor complaint though as sheffer does alright i had a similar issue with scott bakula in barker s lord of illusions not really a terrible performance but i just didn t like him in the role as much as i would have other people 
delivers great acting and greater special effects stars david cronenberg one of my personal favorites as decker it s special effects on the monsters were so good you thought they might be really deformed clive barker however demented scored a perfect on my list 
let me say from the outset i m not a particular fan of this kind of film but nightbreed holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective back in the old days the folks who inhabit midian would have been called zombies the undead and according to what clive barker has given us certain members of human kind in this craig sheffer are born with the potential to become part of that world psychiatrist david cronenberg at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken unto himself a fanatical mission to rid the world of the nightbreed he tricks the police into killing sheffer but sheffer goes to a graveyard named midian cemetery where the nightbreed congregate and live underground sheffer has also left a girl friend anne bobby who still has feelings for him even after he s been killed and is now one of the undead she tries in her own small way to be a bridge to humankind clive barker s creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans but it s plain to see that if humans left them alone the nightbreed in turn not bother with them your sympathies are definitely with the nightbreed especially after seeing a fanatic like cronenberg and redneck police chief charles haid in action clive barker s been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the nightbreed is a metaphor for gay people i can see where that would come in especially since there are a whole lot of people who don t even think of gays as anything human because they re taught that way granted nightbreed is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence but it also does make you think and i do like the way clive barker does turn traditional theology on its head and makes craig sheffer a kind of messiah for the nightbreed creatures 
clive barker of hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting the make up done by bob keen and geoffrey portass was fantastic it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground it was really a treat to see the quality of work it wasn t particularly horrible as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer i just saw craig sheffer in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also nothing spectacular but fair this was only anne bobby s third film and she was good also the ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts as did david cronenberg ha 
this movie is masterly directed by clive barker he really knows how to establish a rapport between the audience and the characters i think there is a sequel missing for this one barker should have dedicated to the sequel for this movie instead of doing the boring lord of illusions that is one i think was a real garbage but i also think that because of this and because of the lack of the sequel nbreed has become a dark cult classic of horror films 
an enjoyable movie without a doubt and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy s rites of passage but i have to say that having read the very positive comments here i was a bit disappointed the period was captured but the plot was desperately thin the whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays the idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a philanderer is risible and without that nada the sub plots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw when all your sub plots look like padding you know a central idea is being stretched beyond its limits nevertheless it s a benign movie with its heart in the right place there are some fine performances and you just get the feeling that everyone involved felt deflated at the final cut that good feeling permeates the film and that has to count for something a flawed really quite good movie out of 
the film nightbreed is one of the best horror films i have ever seen overall i m not a big fan of horror films but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen many horror films i ve seen i ve enjoyed watching however as they are based on horror i know that the stories are unreal as they are fictional therefore i can t take them all seriously nightbeed on the other hand is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i ve seen in very few other horror films this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline most horror films i ve seen are all quite fake but because nightbreed was so incredibly sophisticated and geniously directed with superb acting especially by craig sheffer aaron boone amazing special effects great lighting and fantastic dialogue i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody whatsoever that many other horror films have nightbreed as well as being horror has elements of thriller romance and action all rapped in one if you haven t seen this film i recommend you watch it as i rate it a 
i experienced nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results clive barker is said to have revitalised horror with hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat what an unfortunate thing to happen because like the inhabitants of midian this film seems to be misunderstood barker has created a cross breed of genre staples in this story it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible cue the child the practically klan like human insurgence pitchforks and holy wrath at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before as a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocative i pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as barker s fantastical indulgence gone too far we have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and mr barker make nice and devote some time to it the better 
for a movie like this there s always something to follow by in years to come clive barker the man who brought hellraiser makes a horror movie that is part goth part mythology and all horror in between nightbreed are a bunch of mutants who only come out at night and roam the place called midian now a man name boone craig sheffer claims to suffer hallucinations he goes to this shrink dr decker david croneberg who helps boone with his problems unaware of this situation decker claims to be a purist which he s only a hate monger in disguise boone however goes into midian and make the claim that he s one of the mutants there but a mutant named peloquin oliver parker sees boone as meat his bite however spares boone so after he is killed by a gauntlet of fire arms he s one of them now after being mislead by decker boone does everything in his power to protect lori anne bobby from him lori saves a mutant from the sun and in return helps the others as well i liked the lady mutants one who gives a smoky kiss of death and the porcupine woman who dreamed boone show off her power that is so seductive and deadly at the same time i ve enjoyed this horror movie all the way and the rule of it is never trust a shrink rating out of stars 
this is clive barker s masterpiece in my opinion the movie has a great storyline and some amazing make up and effects the one thing i would love to see happen is a sequel the movie was set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie could be incredible david cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as craig sheffer but this particular movie was a great original creative and entertaining idea and i could watch it over and over again cronenberg was perfect in this movie and sheffer added an interesting spice to the film 
i wish there was a category to place this in other than horror it simply isn t granted it has it s horrific moments however i don t feel that makes it a horror film i will give that this movie could have been better a million little things could have been changed to make it better that having been said i love this movie i m often sad that people misunderstand the whole point of it it has always been clear to me that the point of this movie was to say things aren t always what they seem sometimes evil isn t barker was at a con i went to and he did a little talk then watch the movie thing it was very interesting many things he wished to put in the movie couldn t be and a chunk was cut out of the movie that he believed to be long lost this was a chunk that helped shed light on boone and his girlfriend as well as some other details i know some people are bothered by not having more information about all of the breed in the background however i always felt that gave the movie a more real fleshed out feel i have read the novella this was based off of as well as many of the comics because of this the movie just always seemed like a staging ground for the whole story a much more involved story that sadly has never has a chance to live despite all of the flaws this movie might have i believe it has a lot to offer the monsters are wonderful very imaginative while the acting is sometimes a bit stiff there are some very quotable lines whenever i watch it i find something new keep and eye on boones chest toward the end at one point decker stabs him and shortly after boone falls on a card table he ends up with a card stuck to his chest this card stays there for a while even after lori pulls the knife out it stays there until boone casually removes it i love that that was a lovely little detail i thought basically what i want to say is that if you are looking for a horror movie don t watch this if you believe that at times men can be more evil than anything we have ever dreamed up this is the movie for you this is a movie about how men destroy what they don t understand or fear 
this movie is a perfect example of barkers cinematic gifts to the horror monster genre i thought this movie did a great job of keeping the feel and look of the novella and comic books or actually the comics may have come second i forget this movie was made for barker fans it helps to have read the book beforehand but isn t that important if you can follow a film i saw to anyone who is on the fence about this film read the book then re watch the film you might find a new respect for the movie i came to this movie a big fan of barker already and having read the book prior loved the film instantly there are great cameos makeup writing directing etc in this film this movie does something that most monster horror movies fail miserably at show the monsters they are there in full color not hidden in shadows and taking most of the screen time unlike other films that use quick cuts or trick lighting to hide the creature this movie celebrates the grotesque and casts them into the forefront as the good guy two thumbs up clive we re waiting for the thief of always 
i absolutely love this movie i just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch on my birthday this movie brings up several questions one is who are the monsters of this world to be different is just that different the real monsters hide behind masks of ordinariness they are those that everyone considers a nice quiet bloke who didn t bother anybody or they are worse they are the characters such as played by croneberg men who draw pleasure and power from carving up people and creating their own books of blood i love the shapeshifters people with gifts and those that may be abhorent for people to look upon this movie touches on and explores what is normal who are other and what fear does to some even though i gave this movie i am still sick of women who either scream or are so set in their ways that they cant see what is happening and being a vehicle for the things that destroyed median my other complaint was why didn t they ever make a second film i for one would have loved to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keep me captivated from beginning to end
it s a horror story alright but perhaps not as you know it the real monsters in this flick are humans while the monsters are human and prey as weird as that may sound i see this as monsters inc for horror film fans sure the effects are of a std horror film the monsters are there as in any monster based film the gore is there as well there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker played by david cronenberg i see flash of cillian murphy as dr jonathan crane in batman begins here or is it the other way round and it is decker c who are the bad guys the monsters want mainly to mind their own business warding off intrusive humans more or less misguided wanting to join there society by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters and the dog not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes 
i d love to see some tie in between nightbreed the fury and the x men series sort of the way the second outer limit s series would tie in particular stories and plot lines after the fact to create a story arc although one was never intended i d also like know if some more information anecdotal or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship and or collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg i simply can t get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film does any additional information on the subject actually exist finally it s been years since the film was released and i had hoped there would ve been a sequel by now does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel 
as an avid reader of clive barker i truly anticipated this film prior to it s release i was not let down nightbreed is a horse of a different color rich in the underlying decay of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror yet showing us the other side of the coin here the monsters are the hideously beautiful beings while the humans are the deceptively ugly creatures of self indulgence we soon learn that we were wrong all along by far my favorite performance by the often under used craig sheffer and the added bonus of david cronenberg as decker is a cast best seen then believed the monsters are portrayed flawlessly by a bevy of english creature masters whom many also brought the cenobites to life in hellraiser including pinhead himself doug bradley nightbreed is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre and anyone who needs just a little something more out of their horror story this is clive barker at his finest 
i was at school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much how my school was the school play where the leading actors kiss that happened at my school a crazy gang of lads my school again only when we went on a cross country run we would have a smoke getting the whack some one at my school broke in through a sky light and broke the canes after that they were kept in a safe and as for certain nocternal activities what can i say the film actually came out in i remember that as it was when i bought my house and the film was showing at the same time if you like british films and films about school growing up and period pieces then this is for you another film very much like it swalk came out a few years before and i for one would like to see that again also kes is in the genre highly recommended but trust me is when it came out 
i enjoyed this film the way these mutants looked along with the tone of the film is very good plus david cronenberg as philip k decker was great it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life except for the killings of course i was impressed with the creatures for this film although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget the mutants creatures monsters looked great especially from this is definitely a unique film and not crap it makes me want to go find a read the novella it s based off of this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the monsters are the one with humanity 
i just watched nightbreed for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost years ago and while i remember liking it at the time i don t remember being blown away by it like i was today i really can t complain about anything in this movie craig scheffer is excellent as the lead character of boone i never understood why he hasn t had a more successful career because most of his early work is outstanding as good as scheffer is cronenberg is even better his portrayal of the psycho dr decker is unforgettable and steals the show the rest of the cast which includes doug bradley is very good save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff the visuals are good and in some shots great the danny elfman composed score is as good as it gets and is among his best work the ending was epic with nonstop action for close to twenty minutes overall nightbreed is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker and ranks as my favorite of his movies just slightly ahead of hellraiser 
why didn t critics like this movie i don t get it this is easily my favorite clive barker effort hellraiser is a bit too rough around the edges the film just never leaves that stupid house and lets face it lord of illusions doesn t move at all i have loved barker s writing for years especially his books of blood terrifically entertaining he has a vicious side to him that is totally unlike a stephen king he freely mixes in his own homosexuality and odd religious and occultic elements i love love love love it i also realize however that barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as he is a horror writer and fantasy just isn t my bag puts me right to sleep always has i also think barker works best with short stories his novels tend to wander a bit that was my experience when trying to read the damnation game it started out well then pages in i thought where is this going because it wasn t going anywhere i read cabal the book nightbreed was based on and thought it was good i especially like the elaboration on decker s character the way the mask talked to him and controlled him i like the way barker simply presents it black and white there it is he gives it a simplicity that s attractive and believable when asked why decker kills he says simply because i like it probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point but i actually liked the film nightbreed better than cabal i adore the visual attention to detail that barker gives to his films adore it i think it is just beautiful lord of illusions had some of this as well some of the drawings in the beginning during the nightbreed credit sequence it s like an entire vocabulary barker dreamed up just for the nightbreed world i d be curious to know how much was purely his design i know he is an amazing artist who his own style and language as an artist nightbreed is also i think barker s most entertaining film it moves very quickly well edited it doesn t drag like lord of illusions does a little bit very quick everything in it is just perfect it also works as a fantastic and scary little slasher movie the stuff with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later tormenting the old man in the shop is really scary stuff that mask is frightening i d be curious to know if barker designed that as well it s not just a hokey jason or scream type mask something about it is really disturbing anyway this is a great flick definitely check it out if you haven t seen it highly recommended one of my favorite horror films of all time in my opinion clive barker s best it is scary and violent though be warned
if you re looking for an original horror flick this might be the one for you it s strange and at times lingers on stupidity but it s just such a good looking nice sounding and original movie it never fails except maybe during the over long climax nightbreed is a must see for horror fans or for fans of monster movie make up boone craig sheffer has been having dreams of a town called midian full of mutant creatures in therapy his psychiatrist dr decker horror director david cronenberg has come to the conclusion that boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to turn himself in after almost getting killed boone ends up at the hospital where he runs into a mental patient who also knows about midian and tells boone where to go midian located in a graveyard is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don t let boone in after escaping with only a nasty bite boone is shot dead by the police who were lead to his location by dr decker but boone isn t dead the bite causes him to live and he goes off to midian meanwhile boone s girlfriend lori anne bobby tries to find boone and get to the bottom of this when dr decker also finds out about this place chaos ensues the plot seems long and complicated but it really isn t hard to understand the plot among other things makes this movie really interesting the make up effects are astounding the creatures look unique and amazing and make this a very appealing film to add to more senses appeal we have a musical score by danny elfman that is both lush and bouncy and fits the film like a glove the shots in the movie are also set up beautifully the cinematography is lovely and the movie sets up an atmosphere that is never broken even the acting is good with the biggest surprise being director david cronenberg giving a great menacing performance as the man who for one reason or another wants to see boone dead it s odd for a horror film to be this well done the problems with the movie well there are a few but the positives outweigh the negatives the script features the occasional lame jokes to try and add some humor but almost every one falls flat the mutant creatures look great and for the most part are well acted but sometimes it feels like they are just posing their awesome makeup for the camera the worst part of the film would have to be the climax it takes so long and is just constant chaos it s the portion of the film that moves from individual characters and nice tight knit shots to fiery explosions from each direction and violence happening to characters we don t know or care about overall this movie is amazing to look at it s a well done horror film but even with that said it has the occasional failure in character s lines and a messy climax nonetheless this is one to check out my rating out of mins r for strong violence and language 
adapting his own novel cabal for the screen author screenwriter director clive barker fashioned this marvelous story of outr horror and fantasy craig sheffer plays boone a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer the cops gun him down in front of midian on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society when they lay claim to boone and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody including boone s sweet girlfriend the very cute anne bobby and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable david cronenberg nightbreed displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that i don t see in movies all that often for one thing ralph mcquarrie an old hand at conceptual art having worked on such films as the initial three star wars entries helps barker to create excellent visuals for nightbreed starting right away with the opening credit sequence the visual and makeup effects are elaborate and production design and cinematography quite impressive barker and crew do a wonderful job at creating this whole other world with compelling characters it s colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take in and of course there s the strong sense of social commentary regarding intolerance and bigotry not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person s actions great supporting performances add to the fun cronenberg oozes lots of malevolent intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor while charles haid is a fine love to hate him type of antagonist a rather nasty police captain doug pinhead bradley once again gets buried under heavy makeup as the weary lylesberg and is solid as a rock hugh ross is great fun as narcisse as is catherine chevalier as rachel as an added bonus she bares her breasts in one sequence simon bamford who played the butterball cenobite in the first two hellraiser pictures turns up here as well there s even a cool cameo by s and s sci fi star john agar danny elfman supplies another of his fantastic scores and barker leads us steadily through the intriguing story towards a terrific apocalyptic showdown nightbreed is an excellent genre film worth checking out for anybody who hasn t seen it i give it a hearty recommendation 
nightbreed is definitely my most favorite movie i ve worn more than one tape as it is the make up is awesome the story is lovely it takes a few different twists and isn t quite as deep as the story it s based on cabal by clive barker but for a movie adaption it stays very true to source material the only problem with this movie were the producer s vain attempts to turn it into a teen slasher movie hence the changed ending to allow for sequels eye rolls apparently someday we re going to be getting a director s cut that will i hope clear up this bit of nonsense until then i d suggest it to anyone who like dark fantasy type horror as opposed to freddy jason micheal type slashers i really don t know what would be comparable 
don t ask me why i love this movie so much maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in maybe it is the amazing monster effects maybe because i enjoyed the novel cabal but it s probably because i love clive barker i think it s fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you ll probably have a wtf moment at the end at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the button face mask decker character this is a movie about the monsters about fantasy about a place called midian it s a story where the monsters are the good guys there is truly nothing else out there like it it s not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive s many great works sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian where the monsters are 
nightbreed is not only great it is also unique even taking into account other barker s movies which never lack originality an amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book for the horror genre it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references certainly a lot of fun to have a a bit to think about if one cares to and not to forget a nice music score well the special effects as usual get old faster than anything but that is probably the only drawback i ve just seen it again after ten years and i still find it something to recommend 
what s fun about barker s nightbreed is that it s the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burton s work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the nightbreed as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein s monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie this isn t a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but it s pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look 
i was peeved that the best make up academy award went to dick tracy a horrible film with horrible make up the nightbreed based on the better titled cabal novella look terrific the acting is excellent and david chroneburg makes for a truly creepy and terrific antagonist the plot focus s on aaron boone who has recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery is he making it up or are they real and calling to him his pyschologist chroneburg convinces him he s a murderer a slayer of families troubled and suicidal boone seeks refuge in midian but the monsters don t want him at first he is also tracked by his girlfriend lori who refuses to give up on him even after he dies and comes back cold and monstrous but decker isn t about to let boone continue on he raises the locals on an all out assault on midian like a holy war in gods name led by the devil barkers themes of misunderstood monsters may come from his experiences as a homosexual male but they are always strong and honest nightbreed turns the genre on it s head the monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone but man is hunting them a minute longer cut was originally submitted by barker but the studio chopped it into this fractured masterpiece barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a directors cut release until then this version will have to do 
although i don t like cricket at all and i have seen this movie years ago i still think it is one of the best coming of age movies i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch i saw the opening titles of that movie and then i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there it really affected me personally i still remember how i felt when i first saw it i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days what i really liked about that movie is the main theme of a shy boy fantasizing about kissing his dream girl no offense but if that was an american movie you would certainly see at a certain point mainly climax the shy boy making love to his girl and i really can t grasp this contradicting concepts till now i have a simple request if anyone knows how to get this movie on a dvd by mail please let me know cause i need a shot of memories thanks
it is interesting to see what people think of this movie since it is in fact quite unique though it bears some of the trademarks of clive barker s writing even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard hollywood plot hooks and layered so that if you expect to be fed you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot those who need a linear specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie because the story lies like in the novella partially between the lines or in this case partially off screen in comments and the imagination another possible hang up is the ending of which i can say without spoiling it that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad it is in fact not very defined at all which i know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn t get to know what happened but to me and to many others i m sure just adds another dimension to the story the dimension of speculation and in addition the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far there is definitely moral here but of a rather different kind than the standard hollywood in your face at the end of the movie sort of display summing that moral up is simple even though it is not quite that simply displayed prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different i love this movie even though as many of the reviewers have noted the expressions of the actors with the exception of david cronenberg who does a wonderful appearance are rather tacky i m not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth though seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay all in all this is a great movie provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie 
this movie was really well written and was very entertaining there was great acting in it too luke perry did a very convincing job like he always does if you are looking for a eventful movie to watch this should be at the top of your list there is a mixture of comedy drama and action you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points i was very impressed by this movie the special effects were very well done the whole movie was very convincing this movie is one of my favorites what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an eruption by destroying north america it was a very cool and creative idea i loved this movie and i know you will too 
this is a story of a long and awkward love the daily life of a woman of years old and some people around her is depicted her daily life is so ordinary and routine that i doubted who was the real lead character in the beginning then the audiences know that the woman and a man who was her high school class mate had very tiny connection the woman has been doing the same job a milk woman and a supermarket casher so long there are so many slopes that delivering milk bottles is a very hard job the man had married another woman who is now dying of cancer he works at the city hall and devotedly cares her at home they never look straight nor talk each other but they never forget each other the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books but of course when the man said now i want to do what i ve always wanted to do it was to hug her and make love with her she writes to a radio disk jockey that if god gives us time to talk we need at least a whole day dreaming of that day she has been sublimating the desire in hard work and book reading i personally know a woman who has loved a man for long years even after he married another woman and died for an accident therefore the story setting is not that special rather this movie well portrays unspoken romances in many ordinary men and women through this movie you will recall your romance that is lost long ago this is a movie with lasting effect 
the storyline of the milkwoman is a simple one of unrequited love that despite the passing of decades still remains strong now years old minako obha yuko tanaka lives alone and works two jobs one as a checkout clerk in a supermarket the other as a milklady doing her daily round on the hills of nagasaki one of her stops is at the house of kaita takanashi ittoku kishibe a government official who tends to his terminally ill wife yoko akiko nishina minako and kaita used to see each other as school children but after the death of minako s mother and kaita s father who it seems were having an affair together their own relationship was destroyed lying in her sick bed yoko knows however that her husband s feelings for the milklady aren t completely gone and for the sake of kaita after she has died she attempts to engineer a means of bringing them back together while the story might be simple the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them is really where the heart and beauty of the film lie the film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters their actions being recorded by an old lady who is writing their story for a book while looking after her own husband who is showing signs of dementia in the process it depicts the social circumstances of people from different ways of life how they interact with each other on a daily basis how relationships form and how past and present can collide the director handles this marvellously with a strong structure and visual style it s only later in the film that the story starts to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path as if it is indeed being constructed to fit the narrative structure of the book that is being written it s all validated by the emotional depths the film touches represented most effectively in the exceptional performance of yuko tanaka 
i guess those who have been in a one sided relationship of some sort before will be able identify with the lead character minako yuko tanaka a year old woman who is still in the pink of good health as demonstrated by her daily grinding routine of waking up extremely early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work where she has to lug bottles of megmilk in a bag in a route around her town like clockwork to exchange empty bottles for full ones and to collect payment and issue receipt and there s always be that one delivery stop that s right at the top needing to scale a long flight of stairs in order to achieve customer satisfaction and peculiar enough that stop happened to be a stop delivering to a man with whom she has been in love with for almost all her teenage to adult life and not having the product appreciated but poured down the sink having gone to the same school we see that they re not talking to each other and in their daily life always seem so close physically but yet so far away there s no eye contact save for cursory glances by chance and little acknowledgement of each other s existence we learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all notions of being together where clear attraction between the two was hampered from developing further by the earlier generation while i thought minako was an interesting woman in herself one who has kept her feelings suppressed for so long one can only wonder what kind of damage it would do if i read that the original japanese title means at some time the days you read books and it s accurate i felt the movie had a wonderful finale with that shot of her well stocked bookcase likely alluding to the fact that she s not alone after all and had probably fallen back on her crutch of sorts to deal with the pain of being alone and back to a lifestyle which she had already been accustomed to for years besides immersing herself in two jobs she has those books which serve as a form of escapism and occasionally pens little sweet nothings to song dedication shows on the radio yuko tanaka did a commendable job as the emotionally strong woman resigned to her fate and her decision to love none other her object of affection takanashi ittoku kishibe was a more interesting character who has more facets staying true to marriage vows he spends significant amount of screen time looking after his sickly bedridden wife played by akiko nishina while juggling with his job of social welfare in the children s affairs department in city hall i felt that as a childless couple the job provided him a means to care not for his own but for other people s children the troubled ones who are neglected and left to fend for themselves in a rare moment of rage we see how he angrily chides such wayward parents who don t appreciate and wastes their children s lives away the story by kenji aoki provides little quirks to make its characters appeal and successfully attempted to provide a lot more glimpses and dimension into them as well such as how takanashi is a hopeless haiku poet despite being a member of the haiku club and supporting characters such as the aged minagawa couple where masao koichi ueda lent some comical though sad moments as he slowly turned senile while wife toshiko misako watanabe narrates and brings us through this love story of a single woman at even akiko nishina s performance as the bedridden wife was nothing short of arresting with her character s enlightened state of knowing her husband s past and making unselfish and painful decisions in her sickly state it s what you can expect from a typical japanese romantic movie sans young nubile leads as star crossed lovers but with all other elements in place such as romantic set ups love songs and those quintessential restrained but affectionate behaviour i thought the story was in danger of going down the beaten track when unrequited love gets consummated but director akira ogata managed to steer clear of the usual melodramatic moments in such stories though the story did call for some obvious plot development into the final act that you can predict especially if you re already way past your romance movie not being your average lovey dovey story i thought the milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme and frankly a recommended romance movie though told at a measured pace if you re in the mood for some bittersweet loving reminiscence and seeking to live without regrets 
lead actor yuko tanaka fulfills so much in the exceptionally meditative the milkwoman a tranquil canvass on missed chances in the life of a something woman charting her routine with sincerely poignant motives played out in the picturesque tranquil town of nagasaki akira ogata s unconventional romantic film so to speak is less a straight out melodrama than a deliberate introspection of its characters surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for perfectly embodying the requisite world weariness subjected to a spiritless routine tanaka plays minako oba a middle aged woman who before her work shift at a supermarket takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly nagasaki one of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of kaita takanashi ittoku kishibe a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife akiko nishina minako and kaita were high school sweethearts who courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents separated ways since then opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young minako vowing never to leave nagasaki ogata does as such with the narrative patiently sticking with minako as he deftly aided by tanako s understated yet highly effective performance follows her whether she s having chitchat with her aunt misako watanabe on being single or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk as she and kaita gradually overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast paced narratives but for the rest it s a heartfelt introspection that affects powerfully and emphatically 
a gem from japan where so many of the world s best films are being made today stylistically this isn t anything all that special it s just a simple drama with some comic overtones about recognizable people going about their lives yuko tanaka best known for voicing the character lady eboshi in princess mononoke plays a year old spinster she s takes pride in her health spending each morning in a vigorous workout as she delivers milk up and down the steep hills of nagasaki after she is done with this part time job she works her regular job as a clerk at a grocery store called s mart which made this army of darkness fan giggle along her milk route lives a year old man whose wife is dying it turns out the milk woman and the man a child services worker dated in high school and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other the film actually has some major narrative problems when the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique the climactic sequence is also really forced but most of the film is beautifully small and observant of the two main characters as well as many side characters the film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually weigh the film down but never end up doing so i think the best thing in the film is tanaka s heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life whatever the problems were the film mostly transcends them 
some people may call cooley high the same sort of thing as american graffiti but i wouldn t for starters in ag everyone was white whereas in ch they re all black moreover this one has a motown soundtrack specifically the movie focuses on several working class african american students in chicago and their antics the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships in their apartments we see that there s never any dad around but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie but overall the main star is the soundtrack it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history we even have it on vinyl here at home a classic in the real sense of the word 
you want a movie that ll take you places well this is a good pick if you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film the hayday of motown or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about i suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch at the risk of sounding cliche you ll laugh you ll cry you ll reminisce and remember you ll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight you ll recall with fondness your best friends from school it s a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism misconceptions losing friends deciding what to do with your life i think everyone regardless of race age socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it so take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film there are much worse ways you could spend your time 
at the surface cooley high is a snappy ensemble comedy masquerading as a period piece set in the early s complete with a flawless motown soundtrack but there s so much more to this film it gets better every time i see it the cast of unknowns at the time is excellent and it is notable as an all black cast film that doesn t fall into any blaxpoitation clich s at times cooley high almost feels like an updated urban neo realist film with lots of edgy humor added in at times the rather tight budget does show but the constraints actually serve the film well there s a grit and honesty of emotion here that lends the film an immediacy lacking in most similar minded films like schultz later car wash which was more popular but largely pointless warm hearted but also true to life this might be one of the sleepers of the s celebrated at the time it seems that few film freaks know about this one today their loss this is a fine fine film the bare bones pan and scan dvd no widescreen is testament to just how little cared for this excellent film is 
postwar england the dawn of the atomic age yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the s free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and hormones of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots maintain character interest ala gregory s girl and plenty of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see 
this film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast glynn turman preach jackson is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend lawrence hilton jacobs cochise morris was an outstanding athlete at the cooley h s and even won a scholarship to a famous college there are scenes in this picture with the chicago police department chasing all these dudes in a cadillac and a visit to the lincoln park zoo with monkey dung being thrown around the music is outstanding and there is great photography around the city of chicago great film enjoy 
the movie was very good when it came out i attended cooley high and cooley upper grade center around i was also home coming queen and grew up and lived in the area of cabrini greens i knew a lots of people in the movie it was nice to see friends in the movie that lived in the area also and they had a chance to be a star that may have been a once in a life time experience for them i had good times growing up on the north side and tough times i can relate to the movie cooley high is no longer standing but a person like myself and others still remember the fun we had growing up attending cooley high there is a lot of history around this north side area to be told 
cooley high was actually a drama with moments of comedy it was a reflection of high school life back in the day i attended coolidge high in washington d c from to and much of what was in cooley high was an every day thing at coolidge as a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling coolidge cooley high getting high shooting dice chasing girls basement parties and fights that sums up high school life for many in d c back in the day i can t forget motown because motown music began and ended many a day back in the s the hits just kept coming however cooley high adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in cooley high my classmates and i had a lot of love for each other and like the characters in cooley high there was life after high school but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times cooley high is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories some good and some bad 
this this coming of age dramedy set in chicago in the early s we follow a group of highschool friends as they navigate through the ups and downs of their lives the two central characters are leroy preach jackson turman and his best friend richard cochise morris hilton jacobs both of these boys have promising futures preach is a great writer but a lazy student and cochise has just received a college scholarship for basketball when they re not hanging out at the local diner shooting craps with their friends or hanging out at a friends house or chasing girls they re skipping school riding the trains through chicago or going to quarter parties on the weekends things go wrong when preach and cochise make the mistake of getting involved with two hoods and go joyriding in a stolen car the police pursue them and they are arrested but thanks to the efforts of a concerned teacher snl s garrett morris they are released but the two hoods are not and vow to get revenge on preach and cochise thinking they blamed the whole thing on them this movie is very episodic but it still works because thats what life is a series of episodes some funny some sad some romantic some bizarre the film never gets boring because all the characters are so well played and realistic and the situations are all believable and relatable like preach romantically pursuing a beautiful girl or a party turning violent when some asshole decides to start a fight or dealing with a bratty younger sibling but even when a situation isn t personally relatable like the guys pretending to be undercover cops to con a hooker out of some money so they could get all their friends into a movie the sequence is still hilarious cooley high was the basis for the classic s sitcom what s happenin which aired on abc from even though the show is most famous for the character rerun he is not in this film nor is there any character remotely like him the humor of that show was very broad but still funny the humor of cooley high is truer to life and thus more entertaining additionally the soundtrack is wonderful classic songs from that period by diana ross the supremes the temptations martha the vandellas and smokey robinson play throughout the film adding to the fun youthful exuberant tone of the film 
 instead watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid s in the ghettos of chicago for all of you out there under the age of what s happening was a light hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood i liked it a great deal it just has no real connection to this film cooley high started out as being the basis for what s happening but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences so it was redone as a comedy even though the credits on what s happening still read that it was based on this movie this film starts out light but touches many aspects of life unique to the turbulent s and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless the guys deal with sex betrayal joblessness hopelessness and even early death the ending is quite powerful and serious and the film has a great motown soundtrack highly recommended unfortunately this film is not new enough to be played on premium cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few venues for those films either 
cooley high is considered one of my best all time movies it certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of cleveland and chicago during the early mid and late s what ever happened to brenda and pooter some one need s to track those two down brenda for her beauty and pooter for his innocent wit they both deserve to be recognized even years after this film was debuted i think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie i certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of movie hall of fame all of the cast of this movie was great my opinion is of cooley high is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years 
cooley high is such a great film that even with the period s sound track urban landscape wardrobe and slang it still doesn t feel dated the sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itself instead it absorbs you right into it that is a staple of a good movie from start to finish it doesn t miss a beat and i never grow tired of watching it it s ending is unique in the respect that it s one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings there may have been a few since backdraft comes to mind but cooley was the first and much more emotional 
 cooley high is one of my favorite movies ever i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny this movie was also referred to as a black american graffiti glynn turman is wonderful as preach and lawrence hilton jacobs is great as preach s friend cochise there are some other great characters in it as well and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it from the beginning of the movie where cochise goes to preach s home to get ready for school to the sad ending of cochise s funeral this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot the scene where pooter another one of preach and cochise s friends go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla s feces thrown on his shirt very gross but funny as well the first scene in the street corner cafeteria the quarter party at this girl s house which became a disaster due to a fight and some others are wonderful to watch this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album which is packed with a lot of wonderful motown hits and artists from the early s only songs on the soundtrack were done in while the rest were from the s the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school but their futures seem almost out of reach due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for and preach s relationship with his girlfriend brenda played by cynthia davis almost gets put in jeopardy go out and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a load of comical entertainment get the soundtrack too it is a lot of fun as well 
this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in or i was years old at the time and saw it at a drive in theatre i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie after seeing it on the television along with two of my other favourite movies car wash my favourite movie and the wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together about times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child i would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest movie cochise and preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the wild irish rose that they drank my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasn t seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now i m glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era 
read this boyz n the hood is a scene by scene complete rip off of this movie two friends in the hood one s focused on intellectual pursuits and the other is an athlete the friend who s an athlete gets involved with the wrong people and gets killed the athlete just happens to be washington from welcome back kotter it makes me mad that people don t know this it blows my mind everytime i go into a video store and boyz n the hood is in the drama section while cooley high is in comedy it s an embarrassing disgrace this movie is both funnier and more dramatic than john singleton s rip off at least singleton could have had the dignity to speak out that his film was homage to cooley high but no he never said a word boys men however named their hit record after this film 
there is a great danger when you watch a film that had had such a profound affect on you the first time around that years later it wont hold the same magic as it did before i must admit i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i remembered but a was pleasently suprised p tang yang kipperbang is still as fantastic as i remember it when i was a year old this film has a certain type of brilliance that not many films possess it is engrossing it is briliantly acted and best of all it makes me feel like a kid again and there isnt many things that can do that john albasiny and abigail cruttenden s rolls in this film are st class and i had forgotten how good they were until now i urge any parent of teenagers to sit them down and watch this and see if it has the same affect on them as it did on me p tang yang kipperbang eehhh out of 
this film set the standard for african american film excellence when it was made i heard on various stories on the film through time that there was a push for an academy award nomination when it was released this film plays on various emotions and you definitely feel for all of the characters sure some of the acting is a little wooden but fortunately those parts aren t pivotal the music is sensational and if you don t think the ending is a tear jerker you have no heart in your chest if you watch cooley high you will see that many many films have copied various elements from it in order to strengthen their own films the biggest example of this is boyz n the hood 
now i am not prone to much emotion but i cried seeing this movie it certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups but there is something here for everyone the classic song it s so hard to say goodbye really makes this one worth watching at least once 
shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british i think dvd label specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies mostly italian ones from the glorious eras when everything was possible namely from the late s up until the mid s the label s selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of mondo macabro and no shame they probably even borrowed the name of the latter and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like ratman my dear killer killer nun phantom of death and torso the frightened woman was completely unknown to me but since fellow reviewers from around here whose opinions i hugely value described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro sexploitation movies of its era i didn t hesitate to pick it up this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about of the average cinema loving audiences if you re part of that remaining however you re in for a really unique treat the style atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco s succubus and massimo dallamano s venus in furs yet they re both widely considered as classics whereas the frightened woman is virtually unknown it s all a matter of profiling and good marketing i guess the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion owns multiple old timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life size mannequin doll replica of himself with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street dr sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit but he slowly falls for her just he starts to believe in actual love she strikes back with a vengeance this really isn t for everyone but if you can appreciate moody sinisterly sexy ambiances bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal you can consider this one a top recommendation it s slow stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers shameless entertainment all right 
dr sayer philippe leroy a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee maria dagmar lassander a free thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females sayer retreats to his palatial estate running maria through a humiliating series of mind games threatening to molest and kill her sayer s desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave obeying his commands adhering to his every wish and whim after resistance at first maria slowly teeters towards his objective but has plans of her own she says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm it seems that sayer has her under his grip agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenarios such as lotioning his toes making love to a blow up doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nose which almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with maria and through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness maria gains an upper hand toying with sayer s lust for her body more of a battle of wills a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand through a great deal of the film sayer mistreats maria forcing her it seems to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortress it s a typical european art deco kind of palace fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spell it features walls and doors opening at his command with an area quarantined off for his victims but once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage her and i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazy i felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally the twist finalizes this ideal i couldn t swallow sayer s fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimen we see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin if he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances maria he would later admit is the first he s actually kidnapped others from the past call girls were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman even if it s all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex the spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever know all this psycho sexual sub text is rather fascinating to see unravel but dagmar lassander such a yummy sex kitten was my reason for enjoying it so without her i couldn t have liked it as much because she s vital as a victim worth striving to obtain perhaps the film s highlight the delicious dance as lassander clothed in gauze unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy score it s the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat dagmar lassander must ve been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so well she has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her career even if the film isn t well known i found about through word of mouth the provocative nature of the script and risqu subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sex and pain in many different forms the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative at times i couldn t help but chuckle at sayer s comments towards an imprisoned maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slavery in an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey but dagmar is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at it s best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist captured and held against her will forced into a precarious situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist her submission and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with her there are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him unveiling a possible attraction towards him which in itself might startle some who watch it are among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature my other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody 
if you need that instant buzz that only late s early s euro sex movies can give off then look no further for you have just stumbled across the mother lode subsequent tv director schivazappa s exercise in psychedelic porn of the soft core variety may not generally be considered as a classic of its kind but it knocks many better known titles from the likes of tinto brass jess franco and joe d amato for a loop radley metzger sure was hip to this way before anyone else when he picked up this marvelously twisted little number for us distribution through his company audubon gorgeous cinematography favouring symmetrical compositions may elicit cries of pretentiousness from those who swear by shoddy skin flicks shot in someone s backyard hey as far as i m concerned it s their loss for this is one thrill ride of a movie with twists so well twisted that you may not even believe them after you have actually witnessed them on screen dagmar lassander immortalized as the gone to seed landlady from lucio fulci s house by the cemetery has never looked more exquisite than she does here subtly portraying the innocent researcher held hostage by mad medic philippe leroy with all the art house favorites to his name you wonder whether he has the good humor to mention this one on his c v as their initially violent relationship turns to s m tinged love story nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative gem of a movie with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity i for one was completely baffled and enchanted by the way schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during one scene i ll let you find that one out for yourselves and lassander s gauze clad boogie to an impossibly groovy s tune should have become iconic in a way similar to the image of sylvia kristel reclining in that wicker chair in her emmanuelle days you may not know this film just yet but trust me once seen you ll never forget it 
it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late s italian cinema so pseudo serious and sexually free sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander surely at her very best looking the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings it might have been better if philippe leroy didn t look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that 
i had a great time watching femina ridens a couple of mornings back somewhat hungover for most of the film its pretty much a two hander showing the games and weird relationship of crazy doctor philipe leroy and stunning dagmar lassander i d seen her before in a couple of fulci films dying gruesome deaths but here she is young hip and beautiful the film is pretty predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front but entertaining throughout owing too its marvellous colourful kitsch feel the set design music lighting and cinematography are all classic late sixties italian style a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and though the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more than enough unusual events and memorably bizarre sights and sounds to keep things interesting throughout both leads are pretty good and it bears repeating that dagmar lassander is really really fine the music by stelvo cipriani is gnarly too perfectly suited to the images director pierro schivazappa has come up with quite a cracker here but its not perfect though very alluring there s little substance here and the exploitation elements are about as mild as can be i guess this gives it a sort of charm and innocence but i can t help thinking that the subject matter could have done with more sleaze more threat that sorta thing especially since its pretty simple to figure whats going to happen this is i suspect a bit pointless for stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for people wanting sex or much nudity its more of a light fun pop art affair lovable but insubstantial like bubble bath recommended mainly for those fond of the s dagmar lassander or sweet set designs 
as with footprints i became aware of this one purely by accident it was mentioned in a review of the libertine which i researched when that film turned up on late night italian tv as being in a similar vein incidentally i missed out on that screening of the libertine though i acquired it via the same channel later on but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the english dubbed r dvd during my sojourn in hollywood in late early actually in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it i was let down by the libertine being too light hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme the sado masochistic relationship between a young couple to be honest for much of the time i was afraid that the frightened woman would go the exact same route but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked if not exactly unpredictable final twist the film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era an eminent philanthropist philippe leroy invites a female journalist dagmar lassander at his fashionable home for the week end however it transpires that he s a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate or even kill them therefore for the first half of the narrative we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at leroy s hands including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image until the tables are subtly but unsurprisingly turned she not only emancipates herself from his control but teaches him that man and woman can co exist harmoniously except that lassander s following her own personal agenda as well the leads are perfectly cast and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood furthermore it s greatly abetted by a typically effervescent euro cult score from the ever reliable stelvio cipriani and the imaginative even outr look the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form with a steel trap where its sexual organ should be seems to emanate from freud incidentally this prop figured prominently in stills i d seen previously from the frightened woman but it barely registers in the film proper other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program sexual aberrations and the stars and an idyll at a castle belonging to leroy s family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant one of the highlights then is easily lassander s erotic dance virtually in the nude an episode which actually spearheads the humanization of leroy eventually the two characters have a showdown in the latter s pool amusingly set to a spaghetti western type theme in the long run for all its stylishness the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous japanese masterpiece by yasuzo masumura blind beast finally it s worth noting that the frightened woman was distributed in the u s by film maker radley metzger s company audubon films he would even employ its production designer enrico sabbatini for his own camille to get to the edition i watched apart from the usual shortcomings in the english dubbing department the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack by the way there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film s running time its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from to minutes all i can say however is that the copy i own ran for minutes 
from today s point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film or x in the us the film has a sexual yet sublime erotic story to tell but the pictures are rather innocent throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late s and early s in the fashion the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing 
one year after love thy neighbour made its i t v debut it followed the route taken by on the buses and steptoe son by graduating onto the big screen in a picture made by hammer films it opens with a stirring patriotic speech lauding the virtues of england s green and pleasant land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing furiously this escalates into a strange sequence of white and black neighbours vandalising their each other s homes at least the original theme tune is retained even if it is sung by someone other than stuart gillies the local paper the gazette is holding a contest to find the best neighbours the winners landing a mediterranean cruise barbie suggests to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it that s the main part of the plot the film is by and large episodic one chunk is lifted directly from season namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on union business in reality they re going to see a stripper not meeting two girls another portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he was the only one breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various ploys including being smuggled in through the gates in beer barrels while another seemingly inspired by powell and driver s for the love of ada sees eddie s talkative mother the magnificent patricia hayes getting friendly with bill s father charles hyatt the climax to episode season reappears in an expanded form bill once more puts on paint and a towel to terrify eddie but his friends join him and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to make his way home in the nude surprisingly there is less nudity here than there was in episode season the film ends with the reynolds and the booths winning the love thy neighbour contest and taking the cruise together but there s an unexpected twist involving joan s sex mad brother cyril james beck private walker of dad s army who is working as a steward this is your typical s sitcom into movie with all the faults usually prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about and interest wanes after about half an hour the cast is augmented by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes cast as terry a character from episode season played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill fraser as the factory manager anna dawson andria lawrence who seems to have been in every s british comedy film mostly cast as nymphomaniacs and arthur english the director john robins was also responsible for the man about the house movie funniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints his face black the first he knows of it is when the manager s secretary screams in terror the tables have been turned 
just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini series published in it was not available on dvd until the last few years since then it has become available but initially only in the british format for which i bought an international dvd player which you have to hack illegally i suspect to see it but the series is now available through amazon com discs for between to be viewed on dvd in the us format no hacking there were reviews average stars this mini series is one of the very best on oppenheimer or the manhattan project or virtually anything produced by the bbc 
this is a great comedy highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other based on the hit itv comedy this is very politically incorrect and its all the better for it comedy after all is to entertain the movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot however the cast are as great as usual jack smethurst and rudolph walker make one hell of a team playing off each other in a oneupmanship kind of way it s been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd the fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments means that i can recommend this movie just like i would of back in the s 
a slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where max is choosing a ring in a jeweller s shop much of what follows reminds us of shakespeare s a mid summer night s dream in which demetrius and lysander fall in love with each other s girl friends here max and lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with lisa and alice and alice complicates things when she calls herself lisa on top of the merry mix up max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago and because max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film i wasn t quite sure if i was in the present or the past there is much running down corridors stairways through doorways into elevators etc i accept all that in a fast paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other after four collisions it ceases to have any impact if you ll excuse the pun high marks for art design the apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but i do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in paris saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when max almost exits at the same time however a kiss or two soon makes him feel better if you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks you ll finally find yourself at the airport where max s devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss it can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love like puck in a mid summer night s dream 
a movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot the film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actor s innermost feeling max who has lived in new york for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to paris and unexpectedly meets his ex girlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well the three women max has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations his fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and thus completely no loyalty we can see she gives him also no love but only stability true love also cannot be found in his relation with the ex girlfriend merely a fantasy for him to escape many things very romantic he has done for her but almost nothing seems amenable the one who really animates max s life in fact is her best friend the equilibrium achieved at the end is not identical to the initial equilibrium because max has understand much more about his innermost feeling the nonlinear structure makes the progress of searching look more complicated not equally ingenious as pulp fiction but things seem much more natural in the apartment max is not the only character who undergoes a transformation and in fact interesting is also the description to romane bohringer the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful a good commentary of today s love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 
this is easily my favourite film a tragic romance intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush sheer brilliance i d love to see some more of gilles mimouni s work but at least according to imdb he hasn t made any other features has the high quality of this work made producing another too daunting a task has he moved back into some other sphere of creative endeavour i certainly hope this won t be his final feature but i can t really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films 
so here s a bit of background on how i came to see this movie as you probably know this is the original french film that was then remade quelle surprise by hollywood as wicker park well i avoided that movie like the plague when it was first released simply because a i knew it had absolutely nothing to do with wicker park and living in chicago i didn t see why they called it that it was filmed in fricking canada for a start b i have a very hard time bothering with pointless remakes done purely because hollywood thinks we re too bone idle to read a few subtitles i am dreading the remake of infernal affairs by the way and c i can t stand josh hartnett nuff said there however i came across wp on tv the other day probably about half an hour in and i have to say initially it made no sense at all until about half an hour from the end when it started coming together by the end i was really surprised to find myself really into it and then the ending just seemed so good a perfect combination of story passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices i ve ever seen heard since then i ve heard a lot about the l appartement vs wicker park argument and looking at wp i still say it has bugger all to do with chicago but there seemed something about it that i liked so when it was on again i watched it again unfortunately still missing the first chunk i ve still yet to see it and i still thought it was pretty good heck even josh hartnett seemed good but i was curious about l appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was about so i waited and waited to catch l appartement somewhere somehow netflix let me down so i ended up getting a copy from some website in ireland and i ve just watched it it s really kind of weird but a good weird a classic french film great acting romane bohringer is an absolute gem sorry but she acts monica bellucci off the screen in every scene vincent cassel was a weird choice for the lead but by the end he works and i ve seen jean philippe ecoffey in a lot of movies and i just love him the scene where alice dumps him in the restaurant and he just looks like someone s told him his puppy s been run over was excruciating but i can honestly say having seen wp and pretty much expecting that to have been a scene for scene copy as about of the rest of the movie had been maybe in a different order but come on the scene with the coffee in the glasses word for word you can imagine my surprise when i watched the ending of l appartement i can literally say i was blown away hmm a bit like poor old lucien was through the cafe window really so be prepared if you ve seen wicker park and you fancy taking a look at the original like i did do not make the mistake of expecting an identical movie because you ll either be disappointed or exhilarated at a piece of french movie history a prime example of how you can watch a movie think you re going to watch a pithy happy ending and get whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction right at the end definitely catch this movie oh and while you re at maybe not too near the same time but down the road take a look at wicker park it ll surprise you too 
gilles mamouni is playing with the audience with the story of max vincent cassel in search of his biggest lost love monica bellucci just before to get engaged to another woman mamouni uses many flashbacks sequences without warning so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor s haircut oherwise it can get very confusing still a strong film debut for mamouni beautifully photographed by thierry arbogast the th element the messenger and monica bellucci is a darling to watch i felt a little disappointed near the end so i gave it out of 
i loved this it starts out as a fairly normal slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden halfway through it s turned on it s head this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching plots not one sadly the ending doesn t make much sense which is a great shame oh yes and it s brilliantly filmed 
this is a wonderful thriller i watched many times and never can get enough of it s all about the obsessive love people have for eachother in paris un lucky coincidences false identities the music makes it really gripping there are hardly any flaws in the characters just the end is not very credible but a definite must see still 
a very enjoyable french film this film has many twists and turns in the plot and is superb i have found that when i lend this dvd out to a friend it seems to do the rounds before getting back to me it is really all about a man making sure he finds the right girl to settle down with 
several years ago i saw this film without subtitles on television and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago my heart skipped when i saw the picture in the television guide and for days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock s vertigo a slow brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before what follows is a wild rollercoaster ride of flashbacks changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot and at the end of the film i was left breathless i had definitely not got what i had expected and i had actually already seen the film be prepared to be confused out of 
like an earlier commentor i saw it in and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score it certainly contains some of sam waterston s finest work he and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero which he was but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype 
not all movies should have that predictable ending that we are all so use to and it s great to see movies with really unusual twists however with that said i was really disappointed in l apartment s ending in my opinion the ending didn t really fit in with the rest of the movie and it basically destroyed the story that was being told you spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the final minutes of the movie would have impacted majorly on everyones character but the movie ends and leaves it all too wide open overall though this movie was very well made and unlike similar movies such as serendipity all the scenes were believable and didn t go over the top 
magnificent original beautiful movie the acting is great the settings en decors are superb paris at its best but then the real paris not the famous settings and the music will do also a brilliant storie very detailed which i just very much love the best french movie i ve seen and french cinema is very good 
i think the film makes a subtile reference to rouge of kieslowski as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red it seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red think of the tea room f e i also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years 
l appartement is i think a very purposeful hitchcockian film the plot was rife with symbolism ie the white and red roses and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly the look was very parisian and pulled you closer to the story i saw it in london and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
an obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing i think this film highlights the talent of professional actors specially for vincent cassel who wouldn t at the time it was filmed be the first character you think of for such a role and yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful monica belluci beyond the film during this creation i can only say that this film should have been released at it is in the usa instead of thinking of doing a remake it is simply so french almost perverted and yet so true this film should stay untouched a director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount of ingredients to not make it a flop 
in this tense and character driven romantic tragi comedy we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething parisians at the centre is vinz cassell s portrayal of max a starry eyed romeo he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger lisa bellucci encouraged by his put upon best friend lucien coffey in an understated but effective performance he wins her heart and they live happily ever after that is until the scheming neurotic and obsessive alice the versatile romane bohringer becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three the rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw the eye candy of picture postcard paris at the heart of it all the use of colour does not go unnoticed particularly in lisa s spectacular apartment presumably accounting for the film s title where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust the audience can relate to max he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it in one memorable scene our fated lovers agonisingly separated by a choreographed misunderstanding narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them independent of one another they travel to the same destination her on the metro him in a taxi practically t te t te yet fate seems to have it in for them and the audience is captivatingly teased the performances in this film are really what make l appartement stand out i still cannot understand why vincent cassell is not a big star outside france he has presence and diversity in abundance monica bellucci cassell s real life spouse at the time of writing has recently found fame in the anglophone film industry but perhaps for the wrong reasons true she is divinely beautiful but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic leading lady style which many british and american actresses dismiss in favour of the all too easy subtle approach all in all watch this film i doubt you ll be disappointed it is gripping satisfying amusing sad lavish and a lesson in artistic film making 
a lot has already been written about the film itself so instead of adding to the noise i just want to say a few words on the two female actors it has to be a daunting prospect for any actress to star in a sense versus the spectacular monica bellucci but romane bohringer pulls it off to sensational ends a film starring monica bellucci where i fall in love with the other girl that s not supposed to happen it s been said a thousand times but monica bellucci strikes the saddest figure in modern cinema i have never before seen such innate sadness she would not be out of place breaking lon chaney s heart 
since the plot like vertigo or brian depalma s obsession till to the score by peter chase that reminds the sounds of bernard herrmann this little pearl seems to be sight from fews remarkable playing by romane boeringer and vincent cassel in a bohemian paris portrayed from the famous thierry arbogast a little cult it is a pity that the only version available on dvd are the french one and the english directed by a controversial artist as gilles mimouni it could be considered a little homage to the cinema masterworks it is a french movie and as all of them not for all we could say a d essai cinema even if not so publicized it could be remembered for several reason 
all credit to writer director gilles mimouni who fashioned this winding twisting tale of deceit and betrayal while keeping the utmost control he maintains the audience at arm s length never allowing them to become completely aware of the goings on even his clever denouement has you guessing the three central performances are also top class with vincent cassel romane bohringer and monica bellucci doing their utmost to add to the mystery jean phillippe ecoffey supplements strength in his supporting role to give away plot details or character specifics would not be fair thierry arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this enigma and cardine biggerstaff s editing keeps the story a step ahead of us the theme from peter chase is sublime in its marriage to the ideal of the script many may say gilles mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues on the them of love for me this is simply a haunting elusive riddle that weaves a fascinating web only the french are capable of such tantalisation hollywood would have ruined this with a happy ending monday march hoyts croydon no one does thriller quite like the french when they get it right they really get it right vincent cassell is intriguing as the deceptive max romane bohringer obsessive as the new lisa and monica bellucci is mysterious as the first lisa the plot from gilles mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and fatally crossed wires all credit must go to his manipulation of the clever plot and the performances from the three leads as lucien jean phillippe ecoffey is strong and emotional friday january video
this is a clever story about relationships and a display of three main categories of players in the game of relationships playboys max manipulative women alice and the fools who may be indeed in love lisa muriel and lucien max and alice are very unlikeable and perhaps despicable characters but who are always in control in the game leaving their partners around in the dark but as the profusely discussed ending tells us as veteran players as max and alice were they would be happy to part ways anytime they see fit as if the game was just announced to be over and each one of them could not care less to get on with his or her own life and play another game with some other anonymous people when another opportunity presented itself lisa muriel and lucien might be the ones who felt like investing something real in a relationship only not being able to realise that they were the baits in the game and the ultimate losers as far as what we were shown is concerned who knows if they are also advance players of some sort in their worlds not shown to us on screen this is a very fast paced delicately crafted and seductively witty story with an enticing execution by the cast it also deserves some deeper thinking how much is real in a game of relationship 
 great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for st july uk there is also a scheduled release in states don t know the date can t wait below is my original comment i agree with all the other reviewers it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd the story line is gripping the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns it s very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production i m going to e mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens who did the production was it bbc rw
i just saw this film again i believe for the sixth time i will doubtless see it many more times this is one of the most brilliant french films ever made although the film is mysterious even more mysterious is what happened to the writer and director gilles mimouni for ten years he has not made another film and this was his only one the story and execution of this ingenious film are perfect and it is clearly paying homage continually to both hitchcock and buster keaton the split second timing of the movements is just as carefully controlled as the scene where the side of a house falls on keaton in steamboat bill junior and he is only not killed by inches in this film people stoop and turn and pass one another unawares and if they had been one second off they would have collided the storyline thus walks a tightrope of chance events to such an intense degree that you cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a millisecond or you will miss something crucial the haunting albeit intentionally repetitive music by peter chase is reminiscent of hitchcock s vertigo and the whole film has the same eerie quality but whereas hitchcock had one woman be two women mimouni has two women be one woman thereby inverting the plot structure there are passing references to other hitchcock films but it is vertigo which is central to the inspiration of this film the theme may seem superficially to be obsessive love but the film is really about the magic of everyday chance events the invisible threads behind the tapestry the ineffable everything is hyper charged with passionate love and desire but the desire transcends its object and struggles towards something behind and beyond the object that is why it is so easily transferable from lisa to alice when it is realised that it is alice who is more mysterious than lisa and it is alice who truly embodies the eternal mystery the film is ultimately made by romane bohringer she is so fascinating that she outshines monica bellucci which is really something to pull off considering that bellucci is a knockout beauty whereas bohringer is what the english call plain however romane bohringer had even at this early date more than mastered the art of personality dominance whereby beautiful girls fall by the wayside and don t get noticed because romane is being so fascinating you can t take your eyes off her long enough even to look at the beautiful girls and you end up only thinking of her most of us remember i m sure her father richard bohringer lying in a bathtub listening to opera in the film diva many years ago i would rather watch romane than richard lying in a bathtub but there seems to be some genetic secret to being fascinating because richard bohringer is spellbinding too and he isn t even a woman romane looks as if she may turn into anna magnani when she is much older and that means she will get an oscar if someone can only write another rose tattoo for her the girl has so much passion inside her she could set the seine on fire wouldn t it be wonderful if she and julie delpy teamed up this film made wonderful use of paris locations but where is this square in the luxembourg it looked like place furstenburg to me maybe i missed something i must watch the film another six times just to study the precision of the timing and who brushes past whom and make sure i ve got it right the whole thing is like ten gigantic simultaneous chess games played blindfolded by a grandmaster how thrilling it all is romane you can look through my window anytime mimouni come on over let s discuss impossibilities unlikelihoods coincidence synchronicity everything that is going on that is invisible and how it effects the visible and once again we have here the spirit of breton s novel nadja embodied in a great french work of art more more more 
apartmente l is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people as of now i haven t rewatched the movie and i don t think i will the story follows the experiences of a man max who is engaged to be married to muriel he remembers his old girlfriend lisa he considers this the love of his life as he listens by accident to lisa talking on the telephone thus he tries to find lisa here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa there are many layers to this movie there are undercurrents of jealousy vouyeurism and so on there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience the main character max has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect i don t think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice the character of alice is even worse her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers that is the point i guess the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life in the end she understands that she needs to get away from it all the ending lends a cynical touch because it seems as if max s love for alice is temporary and fake it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option i e muriel than to pursue something that is so fleeting i e lisa or alice in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance in a way the performances deserve high praise vincent cassel as max gives a great performance he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly but the real star of the movie is romane bohringer as alice her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max the scene where she screams i am a nutcase too really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her btw i also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie alice s actions can be explained in many ways and her unreasonable obsession with lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire it may be far fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time that may lead many to question her sexual orientation overall i would give it a i think it deserves it but i subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor i think it is a perfect movie otherwise 
this sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters so there are a lot of flashbacks of re shooting of the same scene but it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result and it would worth it because it s for me just one the best french movie ever made it has everything cast first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel such a presence and such voices even for a hard of hearing it s symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie directing his camera is bright alive plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close up la david lynch cinematography the light is beautiful between gold and rust like their love a never seen before paris it s a paris out of time of more accurately a composite of a lot of districts huge search here it s look like gotham city modern and old at the same time music not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames and the song of charles aznavour made me discover this great singer ah the story as i said it s a love story but rather tragic saying that love can be for nothing that it doesn t make all people happy or isn t guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn t often told love is passion which is derivative from the latin pain you can suffer a lot when you are in love because of the why of the endless waiting the lack of courage the indecision and when you can ease yourself fate destiny god devil can stab you in the back just because you arrive too soon or too late and above all because love means in a world of billions a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written so what s love personally i lived some moments like this in a car with the dear one her mobile rings and you know it s her special friend whom she kisses goodbye and not you even if we are always together so you want to go out of this car to leave them together to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can t because an amazing hard rain just started i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else 
when i watched l appartement with my girlfriend she sighed how complicated and she is right of course when you are used to simple one linear plots especially violent hero vs crook schemes l appartement is hard to follow a couple of the negative reviewers here also have missed one or more important points other whine about the confusing flash backs come on this is not the kind of movie from which you can leave to visit the toilet come back and get hooked again within a few seconds this one demands full concentration and a keen eye on details then it is really not that hard to figure out what s happening and when the director has left more than enough clues in all scenes the first of the movie centers about the question why did max and lisa split the film as my girlfriend remarked begins as a romantic lovestory suggesting that two lost lovers will find each other again having experience with french movies i predicted that the story pretty soon would get a sick twist and i was right in the end of the first part it becomes clear after many twists and turns that max and lisa were manipulated by alice max did not know that lisa had left and why lisa did not know why max did not contact her in rome and left her without a trace when she returned to paris the only one who did was alice and she had her own reasons to keep her mouth shut after both max and lisa have found out the truth the question of course becomes can alice s manipulations be undone well of course not time has passed by and things have changed many european movies use a story telling technique i fully enjoy there is no exposition of the basic conflict in the beginning after which two or more interested parties try to decide in their own advantage instead the spectator is gradually fed with bits and pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters l appartement is a fine and subtle example of this technique in the first half alice seems to be a side character slowly it becomes clear that she is key figure acting is simply great vincent cassel is perfect as the somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks a secured life just to hunt a dream from the past monica belucci is very beautiful of course but also competent jean paul ecoffey provides the necessary comical touch romane bohringer is very convincing as the neurotic woman plagued by feelings of guilt and regret the only reason i did not gave it a is the somewhat unsatisfying end of course it was necessary because of the desired symmetry after all the events max is exactly on the point where the movie begun only wiser and sadder alice has paid for her sins but still the little twists on the airport are a bit artificial max too easily exchanges lisa for alice alice too easily decides to reject max who has been her dream for so long max too easily returns to his fianc e but then again i don t know how how this could be achieved without sacrificing the elegant symmetry i guess sometimes artists have to give up realism for beauty 
a wonderful story about the consequences of obsessive love with the beautiful romantic back streets of paris as its location we re transported through time and see the plot develop from the perspectives of the three main characters as the mystery unwinds 
i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en couer de hiver to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special this film is one of them a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in romane and monica while monica is very beautiful romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she inhabits i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a counterpoint to the characters own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and bewitched like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without throttling the life out of it with the hollywood bleaching common to most movies that become lost in translation americans make brilliant films but not of this type perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english version for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss for those who can read then you would be spiting yourself to miss films like this i would describe this as neo franco noir but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film elitist i think i saw him doing an add for four and twenty pies he thinks romane bohringer is a type of french mayonnaise it is arty in the way that pulp fiction is arty but with more gallic savoire faire out of with every viewing and has anyone got romane s phone number she is the perfect french salad dressing 
forget the recent dire american remake which sadly tarnished the reputation of the french original by virtue of the director s involvement in both this is a deftly drawn romantic s noir with many twists and turns it works best as a gallic ode to hitchcock s rear window because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that fires the intricate screenplay the story is stunningly realized like a picasso painting offering multi perspectives on the same event and demanding the viewer s participation throughout the settings music and haunting score are wonderful as well as the excellent contributions from the cast watch it more than once 
this is a fabulous film the plot is a good yarn and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view what was deliberate and what was coincidence who is in love with who you get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn sometimes literally and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth with a bit of effort following the twists and turns you can understand each of the characters and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema it looks good on the big screen more than keeping you guessing the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds i defy anyone to predict but more likely you will need more than one viewing i saw this at the pictures on its original release three times and it got better each time the acting was very good with a standout performance by romane bohringer as alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble a classic the second best film of the s 
 l appartement has to be among the best french films i have ever seen along with hatred also starring vincent cassel and those great gerard d pardieu pierre richard movies cassel and bellucci are amazing in the leading roles aside from brotherhood of the wolves and dobermann i have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple l appartement sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end fragment storytelling really hasn t worked this well since pulp fiction let s just hope there won t be a godawful american remake of this unique romance mystery thriller edit guess what a godawful american remake has been made 
this is an astonishing film a romantic thriller with a convoluted but perfectly constructed and devastatingly symmetrical plot brilliantly buttressed by the use of recurring visual motifs everything in it is beautifully filmed the women the apartments but more amazing is the devastating juxtapositioning of images almost every scene has echoes of another this is a story told in light in colour in many almost parallels every time i watch it it fills me with delight the acting is great too romane bohringer is stunning as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown everything about her changes with her mood vincent cassel plays a very different role to his part in la haine but no less excellently shifty and sympathetic at the same time and monica bellucci ah monica bellucci well put simply she plays is the world s most perfect woman there s one small scene about three quarters of the way through where she does nothing more than smile yet in that instant says more than hours of hollywood junk one cannot do justice to this film without at least mentioning the superb sequential climax sad shocking ironic and subtle in turn but if one moment captures the brilliance of this work it s the scene at the start of this fabulous denouement the prospect of which has been teasingly laid before us throughout the entire story yet when the moment comes it is handled so delicately so briefly so deftly that on reflection it makes you gasp only a director of staggering confidence would dare to underplay this vital point but the confidence is justified cinema doesn t come much better than this 
insanely well crafted mini series i recall seeing most of it twice when shown on american playhouse on pbs was heavily promoted at the time i believe it might have been one of the very early mini series showing on pbs outside of the masterpiece theater series the full length production was shown i believe only once during its first broadcast was hours total this length was edited down somewhat to hours cut some interesting but slow scenes i am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete not edited version to dvd not worth creating a vhs version at this point would fit in very well in the mini series or dramatic history genre 
although bullet in the brain is without question superior amongst short films it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film and it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot but after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place there is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit it seems like there s almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast a slightly more relaxed pace and a less po faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit despite these complaints there is no denying that bullet in the brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short and even full length films the makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and hollywood action 
on the outside this film is better because of vincent d onofrio law order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the version in some ways the version is better because it s more up to date a decade as compared to the years the actors in this film were great like terry kinney mcmanus of hbo s oz as james daly and tony shalhoub usa s monk and gary sinise csi ny obvilubuly dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasn t in the version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the one character wise vincent d onofrio playing phil romano was excellent better that paul sorvino it s a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james as for george i would praise shalhoub and between martin sheen sinsise as tom i would say sinise wins 
this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people there are only three locations the school the store and the coach s house that are really used it s primarily at the coach s house however a movie doesn t need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up one is rich important and has no real love outside of money one wants to be mayor again but his competition is turning him sour one wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family one is a traveling alcoholic first off i love the actors in this film they ve all been household names to me they proved their worth here one of the most pivotal moments is when tom played by gary sinise blows up on the coach he yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game his blows the coach s whistle and yells back his catchphrases forgive me father for i have sinned it s amazing to watch with energy that just chills you highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn t need shiny effects to interest them 
this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship years ago they have all met for a reunion terry kinney plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent d onofrio as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money cockiness tony shalhoub is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary sinise plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way it s unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other it s not the best movie i ve seen but it s certainly good enough for a viewing 
this is a great example of very none hollywood film making which is very thought provoking moving and not without a sense of humor kevin mckidd and paula sage are superb i actually watched it on late night tv and i can see why i missed it in the cinema its not the sort of film that the multi screen mega cinemas show nowadays mores the pity i am going to look for the dvd not for those who prefer the current trend towards special effects and no story if you liked the best selling book the curious incident of the dog in the night time you ll enjoy this film this film ranks beside the best of scottish films such as small faces and trainspotting all films which kevin mckidd also star in highly recommended 
not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sage s touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you ve seen something special 
a very moving and thought provoking film that raises issues of mental health terminal illness and euthanasia sound a bit too heavy it is a little but this is all treated in a realistically straight forward way within a story of the changes that take place to the family who have to deal with these things this is a positive story of facing up to life and responsibility that isn t overwhelm by the subject matter afterlife is beautifully shot and crafted film set in modern times and dealing with modern issues it is a character driven enthralling film with a strong cast and some very good performances unfortunate it is not the sort of film that always performs well at the box office so catch it while you can 
i agree with andy this is a good movie kevin mckidd s character is believable throughout the film we re forced to hate him and latterly sympathise with him paula sage who plays roberta puts in a good performance too it s thought provoking and emotive without any slush over production credit to director alison peebles and writer andrea gibb for that a very worthwhile viewing the pace of the film is just right raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in rather than bombard you with facts in a documentary style nice little soundtrack to go with the film too again used sparingly not to distract you from storyline recommended 
the film s subject is poignant and very real it happened one can debate some artistic liberties taken by director and scriptwriter the subject is what makes the film tick nothing else i saw the film for the first time after the real phoolan was gunned down in new delhi and had served several years as an elected member of parliament in india by the way she was not the first untouchable elected to parliament as some reviewers stated the so called untouchables have been elected to the indian parliament for decades in reserved constituencies while shekhar kapur as a director is a hero to many india because he made commercially accepted international films bandit queen and elizabeth and a tolerable kiddie movie called mister india which was accepted by the average indian audiences and even got oscar nominations for elizabeth i do not place him as a top notch film director from india he fails in every department as a director except perhaps that he succeeds in getting some above average performances from his actors subtlety finesse charm are not easy to find in his films melodrama brims in them his idea of using nusrat fateh ali khan s vocal rendering of the song in the early parts of the film was perhaps his single major achievement on the undistinguished sound track of bandit queen and then perhaps the creaking doors during the gang rape sequence otherwise the film looked like a spaghetti western with sex and violence minus the great music one associates with them if you are looking for a good living indian film director who makes realistic cinema of international quality it is not shekhar kapur s movies you should see it is the later works of three indian film makers adoor gopalakrishnan mrinal sen and girish karnad and of course muzaffar ali s umrao jaan it is unfortunate that none of those directors had the financial support that kapur had to give them and their films an international viewership for instance sen s oka oorie katha made in telugu or satyajit ray s sadgati based on munshi prem chand s kafan are more complete as films to an intelligent viewer dealing on the state of the untouchables in india sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but merely suggested them of course sen s nugget did not make headlines while kapur s effort hogged them to kapur s credit he is articulate and used his limited talent and modest resources in the mumbai film industry to take his products beyond home audiences for that effort i salute kapur but bandit queen will remain a great subject awaiting an accomplished director to deal with it 
irrespective of the accuracy of facts bandit queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in this movie is violent powerful and thought provoking the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose adversity brought out the best or worst out of her keeping the subjectivity aside there is no doubt that phoolan s character from a young girl of who is married off by her father to clear a debt pun intended to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste has evolved into a champion in her own right her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece bandit queen needs to be studied in the indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience its a shame that the movie had a delayed overtly censored release in india bandit queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india being a woman and that too a lower caste her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess she responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be call it divine justice or judiciary failure had she killed a single person she would have been hanged she killed and got revered respected and glorified p s whoever found her character psychotic needs to be sodomized at gangraped by men at a go and paraded naked then they should be asked how normal do they feel 
i saw bandit queen in over a decade after it was made amidst widespread controversy in india the language the stark treatment and the natural acting by a relatively unknown cast for that time might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian populace more familiar with fantasy cinema the film the cast and shekhar kapoor deserve accolades for the breakthrough effort the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india in fact there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself the reason why this stands out is that it s supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this and a lot else that doesn t find place on the screen and survived to tell the tale survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least phoolan devi didn t live very long after being released from prison in the film scores on several counts the cinematography is brilliant the music is apt the cast many of whom became more familiar names later is very good but the screenplay is patchy things move too fast and in jerks at times it s understandable though because there are just too many strands that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive or maybe i felt that because i have read mala sen s book which is a more detailed and better though obviously not as shocking as the visual account of phoolan devi s travails and which is purported to be one of the main sources for the film there are some factual ambiguities too according to phoolan devi she wasn t present when the behmai massacre took place and despite claiming to be the dictated account of phoolan herself she is shown to participate and in fact initiate the massacre then the final scene where phoolan surrenders shows her touching the feet of the chief minister while in reality she had surrendered to a portrait of mahatma gandhi symbolic value only but shows that phoolan didn t want to show servitude to a living ordinary person it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to arjun singh who many remember was the cm of madhya pradesh then but these are small chinks in this eminently well made movie a rare gem to come out from the mainstream indian film industry made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate masala movie of the late s mr india 
oppenheimer was a great series it was the first thing i saw waterston in and it is too bad copies aren t available a similar situation exists for glory enough for all a british series from around the same time about the discovery of insulin i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was danger uxb a series about defusing unexploded bombs hence the name that one you can get from your local library pete
i think that the movie was really good subject acting and nusrat fateh ali khan s music were marvellous although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of male dominated culture he has neglected phoolan s character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her 
this is an excellent movie phoolan had no role model s to base her actions on yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment i like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up it added to the horror of the story the triumph 
the true story of phoolan devi who became a national hero in india because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner i was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of india instead of the bollywood art trash classics they churn out 
i saw this movie over years ago and the subject still infuriates me as it should her anger and initiative were inspiring not that i would takeover an army and kill people but the scene at the well and at the rebel strong hold will never leave my mind this is a great film but be prepared for the strong subject matter 
it may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to phoolan devi herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in india or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself i do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician i doubt it since then i saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her dacoit days and has gone into hiding as a result her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made all the more so by its refreshingly brutal approach none of the rose tinted melodrama one might expect from a typical indian film it should be stressed that concerns about how feminist the film s messages really are and the like are essentially irrelevant it s a true story her misgivings are it seems not with what is depicted but with the way in which the film depicts her 
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team one of my favorite stooges shorts with shemp is none other than brideless groom all appearing in this short are dee green the beautiful christine mcintyre doris houck alyn lockwood johnny kascier nancy saunders and emil sitka green and mcintyre provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called husbands beware and i recommend both 
there are one or two other shemp era shorts i like more i e scrambled brains but i think one can say without much argument that in this particular episode shemp gives his greatest comedic performance as a stooge after rejoining the team in scene for scene this episode hardly lets up from professor shemp howard s voice lessons with the glass shattering dee green to his futile attempts to win a dame s hand in marriage this is your little snookums will you marry me click to the uproarious finish it never fails to keep me in stitches i would be remiss not mention that immortal scene with miss hopkins the always lovely christine mcintyre btw isn t she rather under dressed and over amorous in greeting the man she thinks is her cousin basil who knows maybe the actual basil was a very distant cousin which makes it legal in some states as far as i know ]
not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted i will only say this nearly everybody says they loved curly best but i will put brideless groom up against any of other the stooges shorts i think it s the most hilarious from start to finish as well as being the most re watchable the off key singing student christine mcintire s cousin basil routine and of course emil sitka s j p are highlights but only around the stooges impeccable timing and the great writing too nuff said 
a three stooges short this one featuring shemp of all those involving shemp i ve seen this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short the basic plot is that shemp must get married by o clock that very evening if he s to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money best bits here involve shemp shaving shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp s voice training session also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious 
for the record i am a curly fan through and through but i do have to say that in reality shemp wasn t really that bad yeah he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had but in his own way he was hilarious at least he wasn t as bad as joe besser in brideless groom shemp plays a music professor stooge a professor yeah right who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle and moe larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six o clock that night or no money this was one of the stooges first skit with shemp before they started recycling their material perhaps it isn t surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture so he seemed natural at this the slapstick gags are hilarious especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth essential stooge short to be honest 
 oppenheimer with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as evard teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest well written well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters highly informative and very entertaining the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los alamos and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project the only downside is that this is a british production and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent the skill of current day australian irish actors taking on non native dialects is amazing the storyline is fully consistent with richard rhodes definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb sadly the mini series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the s and then apparently vanished into oblivion oppenheimer compares favorably to the more recent fat man little boy feature film with paul newman as leslie groves the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered and dwight schultz alumnus of tv s a team as oppenheimer as a mini series oppenheimer is around x as long as the newman feature but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage 
almost certainly the best three stooges short with shemp brideless groom is as good as any of the trio s best shorts featuring curly memorable stooge moments abound the opening with professor shemp giving voice lessons to homely untalented and lascivious miss dinkelmeyer dee green wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances is an excellent example of shemp howard at his best many considered him the most naturally funny of the stooges later when moe and larry try to help him get spiffed up to find a wife and claim shemp thinks he has cut off his head when his mirror gets flipped backward fixing the mirror he cries with relief there i am and pretty as a picture yea moe quickly replies trying to hem his slacks of an ape the best scene and maybe shemp s best with the trio comes when he pays a call on attractive young miss hopkins christine mcintyre mistaking him for long lost cousin basil she smothers him with hugs and kisses also leading to a hilarious bit between moe and larry in the hall not giving him a chance to explain his true identity suddenly the real cousin basil calls and she goes berserk slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of a poor helpless defenseless woman that final line is delivered as she socks him in the jaw with a real punch according to shemp and crew members knocking him through the door and into the hall in a perfectly executed gag what happened kid moe asks can i help it if i ain t cousin basil shemp asks before passing out other classic bits include moe and shemp getting tangled in a phone booth trying to find a lost coin larry getting slapped because of shemp s bad looks his face pressed against the phone booth glass and the great girl fight in the justice of the peace s apartment the great emil sitka delivers his classic line inscribed on his tombstone hold hands you love birds over and over as his apartment is trashed i prescribe brideless groom as medicine for anyone who thinks the stooges glory years ended when curly left true shemp didn t have as many great shorts with the group as curly but that was due to an increasing lack of support from columbia and his and the others advancing ages when shemp was healthy and the trio was given decent material to work with they were still on the top of their game 
this is the very first three stooges short with shemp that i saw and it is one of my favorites that is what i really liked about shemp when he returned after curly s stroke he did not try to be like curly he was his own character and that is what i admire shemp is my favorite third stooge i like him more than curly but i like curly as much as i do shemp shemp is great he s funny he s silly he s shemp i really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt but what i really thought was scary was when shemp had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth he looked like a deformed professor snape poor shemp he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short but that is just typical three stooges they always have a lot of bad things happening to them this short is another must see for three stooges fans 
the stooges are back and funnier than ever brideless groom in my opinion was probably the best shemp flick shemp has the opportunity to inherit which was probably more than a million dollars compared to today from his dead uncle but there is a catch he has to marry someone that day by o clock shemp is a bachelor with not too many admirers except for one high pitched aggressive annoying singing student of his but he doesn t want her he wants someone a little more on the victoria s secret model type of women but obviously he has no choice since he s no collin ferrel himself but when it is printed in the papers that he is to inherit all that money if married his ex girlfriends are on the i want my man back attack what a great stooge flick this is up there with thewinners of all stooge flicks 
 gargle with old razor blades can i help it if i m not cousin basil i think the piano s out of tune ginger grey this is your little snookums laughs throughout the entire minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth adding christine mcintyre and emil sitka frequent collaborators to the mix makes it even better only vernon dent is missing the stooges did some great individual scenes but this was their best overall 
clyde bruckman borrows the premise of this short from buster keaton s seven chances recently tepidly remade as the bachelor in the original buster has hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money in this version musical teacher prof shemp has only hours after all it is a short this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines including the telephone booth scene with moe shemp reminiscent of laurel hardy s berth marks and the marx brothers famous stateroom scene in night at the opera here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine i m not a huge stooges fan but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early s shorts 
ok the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem i e the story started out in life as material for buster keaton s silent classic chances comedy or acting in any genre for that much is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before if it s not a totally original creation here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget short time span of a film they re handling things just fine regardless of what the credits say on their films real stooge philes know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation words spoken by emil sitka himself during a documentary about the boys here what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married is actually organized chaos every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action how many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i ve seen in the last years of watching tv the critics will always pooh pooh the stooges or laurel hardy and others but then again who ever remembers the critic s names or what they said simply watch laugh and enjoy 
the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal hold hands you lovebirds but shemp howard professor of music steals the show watch him tutoring dee green as she fractures the voices of spring watch shemp as he shaves by a mirror suspended from the ceiling by a string watch him as he gets walloped by christine mcintyre watch him and you will laugh and learn moe is no slouch either watch him as he attempts to induce a woman to sit on a bear trap larry as usual is the zen master of reaction all in all one of the very best stooge shorts you won t find one weak moment 
this film got roasted by the boys at mst k but it s actually a neat and nasty piece of low budget film noir the plot is tight the characters are believable within the good boy gets obsessed with bad girl genre the pacing is solid the climax is well handled and the cast is bolstered by several fine character actors true most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick but he s actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind the scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful in a minimalist kind of way sure it s depressing but that s the point good movie 
for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was it was a children s reality show about real kids living at summer camp bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp it was full of romance friendships fights overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for months it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t v regularly but is amazing non the less the show was never dull and always attracted my attention it s really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it s like before going plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that s at a camp for like only a week the length of the camps where perfect for this show and the environment they where in was fantastic they where camps all over the u s that each provided unique activities for the campers it was a truly amazing unscripted show 
bug juice changed my life i know it sounds strange odd weird but it did i am from england bug juice never aired there but five years ago i went on vacation with my family and saw it on the disney channel once i saw this tv series i was hooked i wanted to go it took a lot of convincing to my parents to allow my brother and i to go to waziyatah i have been going since i was and it was my forth year this summer if you are a teenager reading this come to this camp it changes your life you make life long friends at wazi it doesn t matter who you are or if someone at home doesn t like you everyone likes you at camp you have so much fun if you want to have a look go on to www wazi com and check it out for yourself it is so much fun i love it there it is my home away from home
president harry s truman once said that the only thing new in the world is the history you don t know seven years before richard rhodes superb pulitzer prize winning the making of the atomic bomb the bbc produced a seven part miniseries oppenheimer that was a character study of the people who designed and built the weapon that ushered in the atomic age permanently joining science and technology to the state and in particular the military not merely making history but changing the world forever the production is impeccable the casting nothing short of miraculous not only the main characters but even secondary characters bear uncanny resemblances to the persons portrayed in particular are sam waterston in the title role of american physicist j robert oppenheimer scientific director of the manhattan project who was based at the los alamos nm laboratory the site for which he personally chose manning redwood as general leslie r groves who oversaw the entire manhattan engineering district the project s formal name david suchet as physicist and ultimate nemesis of oppenheimer edward teller who nearly forty years later whispered into ronald reagan s ear and brought us the strategic defense initiative star wars and jana sheldon as kitty oppenheimer the attention to detail is uniformly excellent throughout part thriller part love story and ultimately a tragedy this series faithfully recreates a chapter in world history and that of science that we dare not forget highest recommendation note viewers who enjoy this series will also enjoy jacob bronowski s part series the ascent of man and the bbc film of michael frayn s play copenhagen 
i absolutely loved this show never understood why it was called bug juice though i must have been about when it came out i remember they ran it over the summer holidays on channel between re runs of pugwalls summer and saved by the bell or something like that i remember sitting there and wishing i was at summer camp too ha ha all the kids in it looked to be having so much fun it was all about discovering who you are and growing up first kisses and all that stuff i remember there was this really cute guy in it i think he was the main reason i got up in the mornings that particular summer they should have more teen docu soaps like this i thought it was great 
this movie should have easily qualified as a film that best promotes human understanding among people it may be rather annoying to even try to comprehend that a young jewish southern girl could would give shelter to an escaped german prisoner of war kristy mcnichol depicts an amazing portrait of the unhappy young girl thirsting for acceptance and love michael constantine gave a remarkable performance as her difficult father and esther rolle as the maid ruth gave a superb emmy winning performance as an understanding maid caught up with these events bruce davison portrays the german who is supposedly not guilty of nazi atrocities this is how his role appears he has escaped but he joined the german army and he might have been a member of the hitler youth movement the action takes place in georgia in a rural area the townspeople are filled with prejudice even the fbi inspector acts as if he would like to get something on the jews notice the opposite interpretation that as mcnichol is in bed davison is hunted down and ultimately shot it is interesting to see that society views mcnichol as a traitor for harboring an escaped prisoner of war the film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter constantine s outburst at his daughter at the end is some acting as the mother barbara barrie is given little to do it was annoying that she is stereotyped as the typical jewish mother with that loud shade of lipstick on her lips memorably done and well worth viewing 
this film is a study piece for my english class but it s depth and meaning has amazed me since we re looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film its and interesting tale of love hate war and prejudice well recommended story a girl named well off jewish patty bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other they begin to see the others qualities and they earn each others love patty s father despises her and treats her like dirt anton the prisoner of war almost blows his cover to protect her but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone 
this movie was one of the best i have ever seen just the other day i was reminded of this movie by something on tv it came back to me like a dam flooding over i have never been more touched by a movie than by this one after the movie was over i actually could not quit crying for about hours no movie has ever moved me that way before i was at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping i can find a copy to buy so that i can watch it whenever i want to if someone suggests you see this movie with them go you will not be disappointed peggy fries
i haven t seen this movie in years so i don t know if i would like it as much as i did when i was at the time however i loved this movie this is a great starter chick flick for young pre teen girls be careful of the ending though there are tears and harsh emotions looking back at it from a perspective with so much more knowledge of child psychology politics and political correctness i think it would be interesting to watch again patty s uncaring abusive father indifferent mother and favored sister all contributed toward making her vulnerable and starving for companionship patty was sad when anton left she was heartbroken when he was killed the rage that was directed toward her afterward was shocking after all she was only years old the thing that i most strongly retained is how this movie taught me even enemy soldiers are people too not all german soldiers were hateful nazis when i was older i saw tv shows like hogan s heroes and the rat patrol which also made the point that the regular german soldiers were not the same as the gestapo regular soldiers were drafted the gestapo were handpicked among volunteers for their special attitudes of hate i believe that one of the privileges of being a nazi was that they had special assignments and therefore didn t go into battle their specialties were interrogation and torture later during the cold war i would think about russian soldiers and remember somgs we were taught that the soviet union was evil but the reality was that russian soldiers weren t out to destroy america they had a job their government probably told them that our government was out to destroy their way of life which in a way was true since the us fought to end communism the lesson is still applicable today german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda 
 summer of my german soldier was one of the many tv movies that became a staple of the small screen in the s others were brian s song sybil and someone s watching me it portrays a jewish girl kristy mcnichol befriending a german pow bruce davison in wwii era georgia one of the things that the movie shows is that many of the german soldiers weren t really nazis but were just drafted watching the movie i got a real sense of how things must have been in the south back then i mean can you imagine being a jewish person accused of supporting the enemy so i certainly recommend this movie i believe that it s always important to show the things portrayed here occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full scale masterpiece but they usually do quite well i hope that the movie eventually comes out on dvd also starring esther rolle and michael constantine the my big fat greek wedding patriarch 
a touching story told with tenderness awkward young jewish girl in wwii america befriends an escaped german pow who is hiding out in her clubhouse they discuss their lives and beliefs he s anti hitler she sneaks him food he becomes her only friend and ally all this reminded me of the much better theatrical film whistle down the wind where hayley mills befriends convict alan bates but you certainly can t fault the direction here which is smooth or the performances which are sterling mature in her pre teen years kristy mcnichol carries most of the picture and never hits a false note suddenly when the prisoner is discovered and kristy is found out as well the movie gets very tough her father shocked and ashamed that his child would consort with that nazi lays into her with a quiet fury i have seldom seen before he tells her you are dead to me which must be devastating for a little girl to hear the final scenes don t cop out there are no big reunions no hand holding climaxes the girl has to face the world and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors friends and family a startling film 
when i was in th grade back in i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year later kristy mcnichol was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie well esther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaks as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parent s affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the title the best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations the film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 
i caught this one on cable and i was very surprised steady direction and some good performances accent a twisty and very engaging story this one will keep you up all night thinking about what was real and what wasn t check out jason scott lee in the lou diamond phillips role 
this is the kind of film one initially selects to make up the numbers from video rental only to discover an under rated entertaining and enjoyable movie the opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house wherein the wife has committed murder or is it and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened ok the film is a bit campy but has good editing and dialogue professional acting often humorous and the very last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its kind definitely worth watching deserving at least a or an 
i too found oppenheimer to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american pbs david suchet was particularly effective as edward teller as i recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good the only reason that the series doesn t rate a full is for the low budget production values in some areas actual content is absolutely first rate in my recollection the oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the uk on july st it will be a region pal set but it would seem that a region ntsc set should be soon in the offing if you have a universal player in the us you can order the series right now from amazon uk http tinyurl com znyyq huzzah 
the plot of this movie is as dumb as a bag of hair jimmy smit plays a character that could have been upset by the ridiculousness of the story he is evil and a wife beater it s a character as far from his nypd and la law roles as you could possibly get if you ve thought he had the looks and the acting chops to play the really bad boy role her s your present but mary louis parker wears black miniskirts and little black minidresses throughout the movie she has always had some of the greatest legs in the history of the movies this makes the movie well worth it for this leg admirer i d buy the dvd for this reason only if it was available 
this movie is still alive and kicking today thanks to the presence of alan ladd this is good in one way because the movie has some interesting things to say but bad in another because everyone who watches it expecting that tough guy ladd is going to hoop through his usual paces is going to be mighty disappointed without fanfare or introduction ladd is suddenly introduced in the third reel true his role is a key one but it s small and likely to get lost in the shuffle there are many key roles in former newspaperman martin mooney s ambivalent screenplay which hits out at all political alliances and quite ruthlessly denigrates reform candidates it s the lovely and extremely talented joan woodbury who ties the various strands of the wide ranging story together unlike the usual hollywood production the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps much like the films later turned out by the french new wave though easier to follow here especially if you are aware that the film s original title was paper bullets nonetheless some of the film s narrative and character switches are a little disconcerting particularly in the role played by jack larue who has wisely elected to act the part in a strangely non committal way one of jack s best acting jobs ever but no one is likely to notice alas 
flipping through the channels i was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie i must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately i love older films and this is or should be considered a classic one of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl i highly recommend this movie 
great movie good acting a wonderful script it s exciting to find out what the people are thinking and how they react on the situation they are in a pity about the ending a page of text of how nynke s life went on instead of moving images was a poor choice i hope this movie attracts a lot of people it s worth it 
this wonderful film is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to last even so they can be great worth the pain suffering of breakup director pieter verhoeff gives us an insight of the period around the way society mis treats women and how a very strong woman nynke deals with with great costumes landscapes lovely music and good actors and acting this photoplay draws you in for the length of the movie at first the ending is a bit sudden a page describing the rest of her life scrolls on reflection this is a great the best way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life this was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles scrolled by the first being schindler s list apparently the movie had this effect on everybody 
nynke is a classy filmed movie in the same style as the oscar winning film character but this comparison immediately urges me to add that the latter was quite more exciting sure nynke is a beautiful historic costume drama with fantastic acting by monic hendrickx in which you witness the personal growth of nynke van hichtum in her marriage to pieter jelles troelstra the subtitle of this movie is a lovestory so it starts and ends with their marriage but that is where the director makes a crucial mistake nynke s exciting independent life started when the marriage ended she wrote several children s books and travelled around the world what a great life she has lived but pieter verhoeff puts nynke back in the trammels of convention that depressed her and that she struggled out of the thought that her life extended just her marriage to troelstra being no one else but the mother of their kids let s all hope for nynke ii 
a touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimate her the issues are subtly addressed and timeless as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in dutch society today this movie is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism not only the story is well told the acting and the scenery are great as well 
recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family without resorting to preaching or hollywood sappy endings tony marchant s drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in blackpool bleed through but it never does neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and i didn t see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire minutes in addition harry treadaway s performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house at times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic as the viewer i wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality stop moping and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives but under the same circumstances i see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself it s the show s greatest strength truth without sugar coating to force us all to think what we d be able to do under the same circumstances this is a difficult but must watch show i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u s 
david tennant and sarah parish s brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me my husband suffered a sub arachnoid haemorrhage in and required a major operation which involved lifting his brain and plugging the leak like tricia i was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self after over years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew he then petitioned for and i am now going through a divorce i do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury 
recovery is a well judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn t sentimentalise the main characters david tennant and sarah parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident tennant as alan brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life sarah parish s tricia is not a clich d stand by her man housewife who will do anything to support her husband she struggles with falling out of love with alan as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person a stranger to her contrary to some opinion this in my view makes perfect sunday night viewing too often we are shown soft family dramas or detective series like heartbeat which rot and putrefy the brain programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep more challenging and thought provoking drama like recovery would seriously change the situation 
i can t remember the series i believe it may have been american masters but it was broadcast on pbs around most people have some knowledge of the development of the a bomb and those that have little or none probably think it is a pretty dry subject anyone who has viewed this part series does not feel that way you get to know the turmoil in oppenhemiers mind and how the development changed his life forever you understand the tragic figure he became and why with episodes you get to know the major players and the intrigue and backstabbing i have contacted pbs about the chance of obtaining a video or dvd but have never received a response too bad i would love to see it again 
i m so glad i taped this film when it came on bbc last month it blew my mind so gut wrenching and real david tennant is absolutely fabulous in this even though his character isn t always that easy to like or identify with the final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart those eyes i m guessing that he made this film in between the dr who series and that makes it even more of an achievement for me i just love dr who and yet i saw absolutely nothing of him in mr tennants portrayal of this man who knows that he has changed and struggles to create some sort of new identity and life great little intense drama 
i was blubbing like an idiot during the last ten minutes of this exceptional piece of television i have to say that the idea of sitting down to view minutes of what was bound to be pretty depressing material on a sunday was not a welcome one the thought of yet another over worthy bafta winning possibility did not enthuse me however the end result knocked me for this is some of the best television i have seen in ages for years i was under the impression that all originality had left the bbc s drama department our friends in the north was the last production that truly blew me away and that was years ago however faith is restored and honour is satisfied david tenant was incredible so many actors i can think of would have really gone to town on a part like this but never once did i see mr tenant as an actor or as the doctor all i saw was alan hamilton i haven t had my heart wrenched this much since daniel craigs performance as geordie peacock all those years ago sarah parish was also incredible and i really hope this role brings her better roles in the future all of the cast were great but special mention must go to the director who really placed us inside alans head the toaster scene in particular made me feel quite queasy 
when i saw this on tv i was nervous whats if they messed it up millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man in my case my dad would be let down i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints my mums told me she hasn t been able to stop thinking about it i hope this program made many people aware of what it s like living with brain damage and what it s like for the families more programs like this should be made i was surprised at how good it was and it s really shook me up emotionally 
totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor i loved it it is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film except for nicolas read who plays an un dead court jester to comic brilliance but being that as it may i laughed so many times and i have to hand it to the film makers it wasn t pretentious or ordinary in any way raping fighting zombies vomitting on their rape victims what other movie has this not for the quesy but with a pizza a bong and a six pack of beer you got it made if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself 
i felt compelled to comment on this film because it s listed as the fourth lowest rated sci film of all time on the imdb what sure this movie is crappy but it s hilarious it s not awful on an ed wood level it s more surreal and uneven there are some classic moments in the film the brain surgery is gross and great and even nuttier when you consider that the film was rated pg gor chasing after his dolly before getting battery acid dumped on his face mine gimmee zandor vorkoff s speeches at the beginning of the film before amir kali was but another weak nation struggling to break free from centuries of stagnant feudalism angelo rossito also has some great lines no gor no you want these keys don t you my pretties it is absolutely wrong that this is the th lowest rated sci film on the imdb because it is entertaining no matter how bad a film is if it still manages to be weird quirky unsettling or entertaining it has merit and doesn t deserve to be dumped on and dismissed i won t defend most of al adamson s films but this one along with dracula vs frankenstein and blood of ghastly horror are entertaining enough to make up for their awfulness 
this film revolves around an arabian leader amir who dies and wants to live on so a dr lloyd trenton is being paid to transplant amirs brain into a willing participant but in the doctors basement his dwarf assistant dorro angelo rossitto drains young girls blood for the doctors purposes so meanwhile doctor llyod pays a man to kill the people who assisted amir into the country which is reed hadley grant williams and various unknown bodyguards grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road while this has happened the doctors other assistant gor is sent out to get a body for amir and hurts him so badly dr llyod cant operate meanwhile grant finds amirs girlfriend regina carrol and tells her his story grant sees the man who drove him off the road and dorro kills him then since gor failed to get a body d r llyod puts amirs brain into gors disfigured body then grant and regina go to the doctors lab an spoilers find out his secret soon amir gor are prancing around killing people and in the muddle of what i think is plot dr llyod has a brain ray gun which hurts amir on command it turns out dr lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law so then regina dies and at the end amirs new body i think say that it shall be a new country blah blah i still don t get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese this film features grant williams in his second to last film roll i recommend it for any fan of al adamson or if you like brains 
american made final entry in the blood island series of filipino horror films concerns abdul amir reed hadley ruler of a fictional country he dies of cancer yet it s figured out how to bring him back put his brain into a donor body the mad doctor in charge kent taylor puts it in a highly unlikely body the facially scarred giant manservant named gor john bloom a doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors plans film making partners samuel m sherman producer and al adamson director corral several actors they ve worked with before including taylor adamsons sexy wife regina carrol angelo rossitto zandor vorkov and vicki volante they tried to go for the feel of the previous blood island entries but one can tell this was made stateside while not necessarily a good film it s got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole a malevolent dwarf rossitto gory operations a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom the political intrigue subplot caverns full of cobwebs etc the narrative is actually pretty coherent with plot twists thrown in here and there i think it could have been trimmed a bit some scenes drag but it s got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect for this kind of thing the acting isn t too bad both taylor and rossitto are fun the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role volante is appealing enough and williams is o k in the heroic role in any event it s nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films absolutely nothing special but as a trashy b horror i use the word loosely none of this is exactly scary film it certainly amuses 
brain of blood starts as abdul amir reed hadley the leader of a country called kahlid is close to death because of cancer however if he dies kahlid will tear itself apart without anyone to lead them so doctor robert nigserian grant williams one of amir s devotees mohammed zandor vorkov have devised a plan to take amir s dead body to america where mad scientist dr lloyd trenton kent taylor will transplant his brain into a fresh body with a bit of plastic surgery no one will ever know he was even dead things don t go according to plan though as when the time comes to transplant amir s brain trenton s freak assistant gor john bloom brings a dead body of someone that fell from a balcony trenton needed a strong fit living body since there s no more time he decides to use gor s body as a temporary stop gap until another more suitable one can be found unfortunately when amir wakes up in his new body he s not very happy at what he sees i mean would you be if you found out your brain was inside a badly burned freak also known as brain damage the brain the creature s revenege the undying brain this cheapo exploitation flick was produced directed by the one only al adamason quite frankly i m offended at the pathetic rating brain of blood has on the imdb personally i think it s terrific fun in a so bad it s good sort of way the highly entertaining script by kane w lynn joe van rodgers is as loopy silly as they come from sloppy blood soaked brain transplants to crazed mad scientists from foot tall acid scarred freaks who play with toy cars to foot tall midget medical assistant s from basement dungeons to rooftop chases from car crashes to assassination s kidnaps to screaming scantily clad women from regina carrol s hair do which should get it s own mention during the opening credits to teenage girls imprisoned in the basement for blood to a laugh out loud hilarious ending which includes some deep meaningful speech it s all here brain of blood has quality cheese stamped all over it if your a fan of bad low budget exploitation flicks with a sense of fun then this film should be right at the top of your list of must see films despite it s lowly rating i am proud to admit that i liked brain of blood a lot i thought it was an absolute hoot to watch it slows down a bit at the end with a few too many shots of people wandering around doing nothing in particular but until that point it had moved along like a rocket at only minutes it s relatively short it s difficult to second guess the barmy plot i just think it s loads of campy fun this is director adamson s masterpiece as far as i m concerned along with dracula vs frankenstein which he made a year before this those who have seen an adamson film before will know about the none existent production values cheap special effects cardboard sets that all adds to the fun this film manages that fine between incompetence seriousness to create a memorable viewing experience i love the opening shot of kahlid which is obviously just a photo of the taj mahal in india complete with statuesque people in the foreground regina carrol s hair seems to be a separate entity on it s own it seems to change styles between shots is frankly horrendous don t get me started about her make up job either that she must apply with a a paint sprayer there is another hilarious moment when we see amir s body has been transported to america wrapped in what looks like ordinary tin foil why is the question i asked myself why the effects are variable there s a terrible looking fake spider gor s burned make up job is pretty bad although there is a surprisingly gory brain removal which is actually quite impressive the budget for brain of blood must have been practically none existent i must admit i thought trenton s lab was quite good with various computers medical instruments although the rest of the film looks cheap nasty the production values are low the music was taken from another film beast of blood the acting is awful but in a campy fun sort of way brain of blood may have the best title for an exploitation film ever as far as i m concerned it s a highly entertaining piece of nonsense that i had a great time watching laughing at they just don t can t won t make them like this anymore impossible to recommend to anyone looking for a good film but bad movie lovers should enjoy it i liked it but then again i m just weird 
i saw this black and white comedy noir yesterday at the london film festival structurally it has been compared to pulp fiction but it is perhaps closer to the structure of amores perros and the slacker mood of kevin smith s clerks four stories intersect at a french motorway diner the first vignette has franck edouard baer bungling a hold up at the diner the waitress suzie anna mouglalis takes pity and tell him her story the second has two incompetent kidnappers leon bouli lanners and paul serge lariviere take a teenage girl from her rich family unfortunately for them she is suicidal and her family don t appear to want her back the third is a dialogue between two ageing rock stars who bump into each other at the diner alain bashung and arno playing themselves the final part is about four ex criminals who smuggle their old partner out of hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into the diner an epilogue returns to franck and suzie to complete their story not really an epilogue more a conclusion the structure does not really work the stories are not sufficiently intertwined as in pulp fiction nor is the diner crucial to the action to at least two of the stories in the way the car crash was crucial in the four stories of amores perros the quality of the individual stories varies the hideout story is a cute idea with a couple of good gags but does not come off and the rock star reunion is pointless and dull on the other hand the kidnap story is hilarious although its connection to the diner is tenuous the most balanced and successful story is the franck and suzie one this film isn t entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity i look forward to seeing more of writer director s samuel benchetrit s work 
this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over the hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once thirty years previously was their hideout one ho hum duologue between two ageing rock musos a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence plus epilogue involving heist artist wannabe edward baer and current hot property anna magloulis which has its moments no movie in which jean rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over the hill quintet indeed the film is worth seeing for rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it s definitely worth a look 
i watched this mini in the early eighties sam waterson proved himself to be a great actor in fact when he began law and order i was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills i wish i could find a copy of this rare series and review it it is both factual and entertaining everyone should see it to know what really happened i was so moved i purchased and read the book pppenheimer shatterer of worlds and saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight if you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance mr waterston can really provide an audience enjoy the movies 
i first saw it at am january and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again love everything well almost so stars about it no color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters anna camera work music well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops but this is not a musical after all i like anna s acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile no it s not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments it s just so subtle excellent work by samuel benchetrit though d nouvelle seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas and the last scene is my favorite makes me feel so warm and romantic yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art housish movies and i don t agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction it s not about action and twisted story though all vignettes intersect it s calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people it s about characters their feelings very subtle anyway probably this review won t be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciation spoiler this movie doesn t have a goofs section wonder didn t anybody notice that hand in the part when the kidnappers decided to go home looks like a part of crew hehe i know i should better post this in forums but i don t agree with some policies here 
this movie definitely shows something and sheds light on what happens in most institutions today and shows how one gurl just with the help of her newspaper manages to get things done her editor has complete faith in her and doesn t publish something important because it would harm her friend and when it was the right time she took the necessary action the movie overall got a rating of from me because its got everything i mean it keeps you entertained and moreover they have acted really well for a tv movie its really high quality acting that deserves alot of credit 
i liked this movie many people refer to it as sabrina the teenage feminist they do that with a lot of movies that melissa joan hart is in still she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of mary who fights for justice when her roommate is raped you could tell that hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed i also liked lisa dean ryan as mary s roommate she was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped josh hopkins was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist lochlyn munro convincingly played his character the acting in this movie is better than in most tv movies in my opinion the movie was pretty predictable though also i expected more from the ending it was too abrupt the delivery could have been better but the performances and overall plot make up for these problems 
i actually flipped to lifetime channel by mistake just as this movie was beginning and ended up watching it it certainly deals with a serious issue probably more prevalent than we realize in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego maniacal fellow student who feels he s above the system and unfortunately often is the cast here was believable and the performances credible a lot of these canadian lifetime flicks are decidedly over the top however this is one i might label as under the top while appreciating the fact that it wasn t presented in an overblown fashion this film somehow seemed like a record being played at a slower speed than proper the minutes seemed like many more and it had the effect of looking like a shorter film looped over and over seemingly going on and on and on and on before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion yet the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average film of this type despite these criticisms and while these pictures often milk the climax this one could have given it a bit more detail and length 
in my work with the only nationwide non profit organization security on campus inc dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness i see all too often the type of campus violence and `cover up through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie `silencing mary in fact we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters such as `mary who are facing similar situations its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by `mary the victim s roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by melissa joan hart for justice was very well done and accurately researched this was the first television movie that i have ever seen that i felt truly reflected and encompassed all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation s college and university campuses although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in hours this movie comes closer than any others i ve seen 
this production was quite good the usual fabulous scenery interesting quirky characters it was just so strange not to have captain hastings miss lemon and poirot s office residence so prominently featured in the original pbs bbc mysteries in the original series so much took place at the office hastings reading the paper while poirot exercises his little gray cells miss lemon pitching in whenever needed poirot without capt hastings would be like holmes without watson he can most certainly solve the crime but it is not as interesting and what would a poirot mystery be without hastings with his impeccable manners falling for some beautiful unattainable woman 
count me as being one who is happy to see no hastings in this episode the poor man s dr watson does nothing for me as he simply drags down every scene he s in japp is often necessary to the story as the representative of officialdom and a little miss lemon is fine for seasoning but hastings swings from painfully dim to over mannered in different episodes if i have to sit through one more vacuous oh i say there i ll take the gas pipe as a general rule the more poirot you get in a poirot story the better every line for hastings is one taken away from poirot and i ve never read the books so i really don t care about fidelity to christie s characters a lot of viewers reviewers seem to have a problem with separating the movies from the books if you want the book as written then read it i don t see the point of watching the television version if you know what will come next at every stage theatre is not prose don t expect a transcription 
richard abernethie a very wealthy man has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral included in the funeral party is abernathie s youngest sister cora galaccio while none of the family has seen cora in at least years they all agree that cora was always a bit different so when cora says something about abemethie having been murdered most laugh it off as one of cora s eccentricities but someone is obviously taking cora seriously the next day cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently is there a connection between the two deaths it s up to hercule poirot to find a killer after the funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire poirot series i ve always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and from what i remember the movie is as faithful to christie s source material as any of the poirot installments the mystery is top notch with plenty of clues suspects and red herrings and as i ve written before i always enjoy an christie story where hercule poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal it might be old fashioned but that s the way i like it getting beyond the plot technically and artistically after the funeral is a winner sets editing direction and cinematography are as good as you ll find in one of these movies the acting is equally impressive i ve come to expect an enjoyable performance from david suchet as poirot and he doesn t disappoint here the rest of the cast is just as strong with monica dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced i ve got no real complaints it s a good show all the way around 
although i have definitely read this particular agatha christie book at some point i didn t remember anything about it except the name abernethie which is a good thing because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer genius of agatha christie the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness in addition to her stories the excellent production values beautiful locations wonderful music top notch acting elegant directing etc are the reasons for this series success and timelessness and all those virtues are present in after the funeral a word of advice be alert right from the start there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence there are some quite unnerving moments as well in contrast to the peaceful looking english countryside locations and some small touches of humor a must see for mystery buffs and just a very good film in general 
as most other reviewers seem to agree this adaptation of after the funeral is very good indeed always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be messed about with well it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and as others have pointed out the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist i also really enjoyed fiona glasscott who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really the casting was quite impeccable throughout one point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn t mind how they tightened up the structure of the abernethie family in the book the family tree is really quite complicated the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end when they all leave enderby quite touching this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far 
absolutely the best thing i have ever seen on tv it was both entertaining and informative the reason i found this site is an attempt to find out how i can again see it in the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with gen leslie groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the manhattan project most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past the casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding it was the first time that i noticed sam waterston as an actor except for height he looked very much like robert oppenheimer the early scene in which oppenheimer is leading a class of graduate students was especially intriguing to me 
some less than inspired opening string music notwithstanding we somehow know that from the word go this is heading straight for the big fun drawer by the time we observe monica dolan in a truly genius bit of casting delightfully goofing it up as cora early on we re already hooked but it is only later on when she reveals herself in her marvellous screen creation that deranged scheming maleficent queen of murder and deceit posing in the guise of the uptight miss gilchrist that she not only effortlessly steals the entire telemovie for herself but quite simply blows off screen anyone who comes near her including the ever well measured david suchet who himself seems to be somewhat bedazzled by her acting talents and very gentlemanly allows her to take centre stage dolan is the true engine of the film and her miss gilchrist a genuinely well rounded character in this christie rendition helped by a zesty script and the sprightly paced direction and also by the rest of the cast led by geraldine james and dominic jephcott who all display signs of sympathy for the given material and play with relish accordingly the production values are spot on as usual and if there are any weaker links they might be located in the comparatively substandard music score to the majority of later poirots and also perhaps in the lacking of a genuine italian born actor for the role of cora s husband other than that this is an hour and a half of pure televisual delight which is as self indulgent and entertaining as it is lovingly put together 
i saw this film on the a e channel this past weekend the mystery was okay i was not able to guess the culprit before the end but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery there was a mystery about some of them especially george abernathie performed by the wonderful michael fassbender and george s cousin susannah in fact the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more from what i ve tried to glee about the agatha christie book of the same title i think this film did not follow it to the letter very good performances by the actors involved especially fassbender and the lady who played cora companion 
after the funeral was absolutely superb and by far the best episode of the season i was disappointed with cards on the table that started off so well but let down considerably by the last half hour and i didn t know what to think of taken after the flood though i do remember being confused at the end after the funeral as i ve said is one of my all time favourite poirot episodes up there with five little pigs sad cypress and the abc murders i was afraid that they would ruin the story but instead it is very faithful to the book now i will say i don t mind changes to books and try not to compare movies and tv adaptations to their sources except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation doesn t do it justice that s why i disliked some of the marples like nemesis and sleeping murder and so far out of the poirots the murder of roger ackroyd taken at the flood and cards on the table are the only ones that really did disappoint everything else ranges from good to outstanding even the recent appointment with death despite the many deviations from the book which i admit isn t a favourite was surprisingly good thanks to the marvellous production values stellar ensemble performances and outstanding music score back to after the funeral the production values are fantastic it has a really cinematic feel to it and the stunning photography and splendid scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes the music was very stirring and even haunting and the entire cast give wonderful performances david suchet is impeccable as always as poirot and geraldine james and anna calder marshall are just as terrific but for me the standout was monica dolan as mrs gilchrist she is up there with donald sumpter and polly walker as the best supporting actor actress in a poirot episode that s how good her performance was all in all a must see one of the best poirot episodes by far and one of the more faithful ones too bethany cox
for those of you still in the dark i will not spoil this christie as it is definitely one of her finest works and i stress that you should see it whenever you next have free time if any of the adaptations are to be watched before or in lieu of reading the book i would suggest after the funeral for the following reasons i wanted to praise the performance by monica dolan miss gilchrist whose employer companion cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film her portrayal of a shocked nervous insignificant woman is actually moving especially when she has a moment of personal connection with poirot another person who travels alone in the journey of life and when the murderer is being revealed in typical poirot denouement fashion dolan s reactions to the revelation are acting at its finest you feel as angry at the murderer as you do sympathetic to miss gilchrist something uncommon in christie lore although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation as per usual the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film the unbelievably lavish recreation of post war england thoroughly high calibre of acting and directing and preservation if not heightening of christie s mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies insignificant bravo suchet dolan and the whole team for crafting this masterpiece of murder mystery theatre and the producers who gave it the green light encore 
aunt cora had always been tactless and her well bred family ignored the remark she made after her brother richard s funeral he was murdered wasn t he they remembered it the next day when cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet for some reason the poirot movies this year have been far from faithful to the original book i was disappointed about the changes made in cards on the table my favourite poirot book after the funeral is my nd favourite poirot book and i was scared the story would be destroyed it wasn t the movie was nearly page for page faithful throughout right down to the killer s motive all the actors were wonderful but my favourite has got to be monica dolan who gives a great performance as miss gilchrist the companion to the late aunt cora without a doubt the best poirot movie ever 
david suchet is agatha christie s mustached detective hercule poirot in after the funeral produced in anyone who has heard david suchet speak with his own british accent knows what a shock it is because his accent as poirot is so perfect and organic to the character suchet is the poirot of agatha christie s books and although i confess a love for peter ustinov in the role his portrayal doesn t have that much to do with what christie wrote in this episode poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients enroute on the train the solicitor recounts the events after the death a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man s sister that he was murdered when poirot meets the family he discovers adultery lots of secrets another will and murder the story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful detailed depiction of the time period all of the acting is superb particularly from monica dolan who plays miss gilchrist poirot here is without hastings his beautiful office or miss lemon but he s effective nonetheless i had the privilege of seeing david suchet on broadway in amadeus breathtaking what an actor when he s playing poirot all i see is poirot 
i was surprised that i liked this movie but it reminded me of a version of the first friday the th there were a number of cheesy elements yet at the same time there were many cool ones the story line was good predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies but full of one liners to make it worthwhile there are some memorable scenes worth watching a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows which were humans on stakes whose blood was drained to grow the crops looked very real but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks there were more than several gaps in the plot and the acting was mediocre but at least it sounded like how real people talk unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it the culmination of the last scene when the main character says i m not a baker i m a connell and lops the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point 
this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch i mean it wasn t great but it was one of the better horror movies of late it seems to have been low almost state benefit budget size but it has it s charms like the lovely ladies in it the atmosphere was good also which is what is missing froma hell of a lot of horror movies these days the acting was your typical s low budget affair that being in case you don t know is that it is dud acting but that is what lucio fulci s movies were full of they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc they more than made up for in the horror gore atmosphere for the movie it s self it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable i watched it all the way and i love horror movies i ve seen movies where i just turn off within to minutes or sit and fast forward it if it s on video or skip scene s on the dvd this movie didn t make me want to do that i sat and watched it all the way to the end without wanting to skip parts i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy kreuger as your babysitter not but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection maybe the music in this movie was top notch stuff ideal horror music so it was i ve seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better thank goodness though this movie didn t have nay of the metal music in it i ve been a die hard metal fan since but in horror movies metal music spoils it the movie looses atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing so i m glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy well done it could have use profane grace epitaph of shattered dreams on it though as it is keyboard music no guitars no nothing except really creepy keyboard tracks like track one forever sleep you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some goose bump inducing keyboard music that follows it ever track on that cd is the same ideal horror music at it s best it would have suited this movie perfectly the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got chibbed killed or so we are led to believe and hung up as a scarecrow only to get free and try to escape later every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed a big out of for them all except the one i mentioned above i wish that hollywood mainstream side of things would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a goon muppet called paul anderson of the resident evil mince well done guys it is not bad not bad at all i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie behind the scene s not many movies do this kind of thing which i thought added a little to the movie as it also showed you some outtakes of sorts and that s always a good thing if you ask me rating for this movie rating for the lovely ladies in the movie rating for the atmosphere in the movie rating for the score for the film 
do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine kind of east german version of buffalo soldiers nva works on a meta level that it sympathizes with its heroes attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can it s not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles utopian of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtful just to fill the required lines do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job 
don t quite know why some people complain about this film not being a comedy and at the same time being too unrealistic if it had been realistic there certainly wouldn t have been much comedy i also don t think that a comedy needs to make you laugh aloud twenty times there was much subtle humor sweet feelings and kim frank just portrayed a dreamy character in real life there are many people whose facial expression doesn t change much so kim frank keeping his was quite all right the ending was quite unrealistic i d say but happy it s a light hearted movie with a feel good ending i liked it loved it actually a serious part was krueger going to schwedt and i m glad they didn t show what happened to him there showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly 
i saw this series on pbs in in college and i still can t get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots 
nva combines eastalgia humor military comedy and teen movie although it is somehow typically german movie like sentimental i think it s a great and very funny movie you will not only laugh in nva but also get a bit of an insight in the eastern germany armed forces of the late ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the german democratic republic you will enjoy nva if you liked sonnenallee another movie directed by leander hau mann but not necessarily if you enjoyed good bye lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny the acting is acceptable but watch for former boy band singer kim frank who has only two facial expressions natural and shocked saucer eyed 
it s just stories some we wish happen to us some we wish never happen to us all about unfulfilled desire the locations and nude bodies are beautiful but after the second story all i could think was it takes more than just beauty to create a real film then of course the film unfolds the stories are moving except sophie marceau fails to communicate her story in this film malkovich plays the story for both of them though the voiceover fails to link the stories but helps malkovich to provoke some thought i d say it is worth seeing and the best of antonioni i have seen given his age remarkable 
antonioni with wim wenders some of the best of the best story character visuals like most of their works it is not really aimed at the children or the childish don t miss the genius contained in this one 
a wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups yes they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the hollywood fluff this all under the masterful direction of antonioni and wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots it is great to see that there is lust in the mid life crises sector 
 beyond the clouds is an over the top artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a man woman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers there s little meat on the bones of this fragmented work a taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in hours than with four nonetheless beyond the clouds will be fodder for dilettantes and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance 
looks like the bet movie i ve ever seen not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive antonioni is comparably wise to his movie malkovich s so organic roles are so true situations are so real i ve change my world outlook after this cinema i m a beginner literati in russia country of tolstoy and dostoevskiy and i m quite sure watching antonioni is good and fun for russkies because i and we do understand his point of view so i don t understand his lesser raiting on imdb i m sure speaking from russia and our people we like antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality
first the positives an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de chirico sophie marceau beautiful the negatives the stories are hard to believe unreal uni dimensional characters preen and posture of the time as if they were in some kind of catwalk this is neither the antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the wenders we ve all come to know and appreciate malkovich is excess baggage in this movie 
amazing movie some of the script writing could have been better some cliched language joyce s the dead is alluded to throughout the movie beautiful scenery and great acting very poetic highly recommend 
if you speak french or can put up with sub titles you will really enjoy this movie if on the other hand you just want to see god s most beautiful creatures this is a must see not an ounce of silicon in sight zalman king eat your heart out sophie marceau s body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever fantasized about her part is even in english even the fact that she was nude with john malkovich did not detract for her beauty sophie is a ten if ever there was one chiara caselli and in s sastre are s oh yeah it is a pretty good story several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of separation style 
this the the final feature film that michelangelo antonioni directed with the help of wim wenders and adapts from his short story collection that bowling alley on the tiber beyond the clouds contain short stories with familiar themes that we ve come to be accustomed to from his earlier works and sums up those themes in vignettes which are weaved together via wenders directed scenes involving john malkovich s the director character however most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth that we re used to from an antonioni movie while malkovich s narration of supposed depth rattled on with unclear diction that sounded a tad pretentious and out of place nonetheless all four stories seem to touch on chance encounters and extremely quick romances that played out more like lust at first sight perhaps due to the lack of time since they re short stories anyway to allow for a more layered approach to carefully define and craft the characters as we know from a typical antonioni movie and the obsessive approach here is for the characters to disrobe to showcase a lack of deeper connection sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh maybe this is the point to want to bring across with an observation of the more modern relationship the first story story of a love affair that never existed tells the romance between silvano kim rossi stuart and carmen ines sastre who meet when one asks the other for directions to a hotel and later meet at a cafe it s as if fate is playing games on them when they meet but part and meet again much later but like the games people play it s almost like a l avventura or a la notte with the lack of communication and of the expectations from the man john malkovich s director character takes central role in the next short who exhibited some really lecherous looks toward a girl working at a shop played by sophie marceau she is deeply disturbed and made to feel uncomfortable but somehow plucked up the courage to approach him and in what i thought was to scare him off tells him her background that she murdered her father by stabbing him times but in a flash these two are off toward bedroom gymnastics the next short don t look for me is the longest of the lot with peter weller playing a cheating husband who has to choose between his mistress chiara caselli or his wife played by fanny ardant perhaps the more star studded of the lot with jean reno also stepping in for a coda at the end of it which sort of expands the little universe in which this short exists but unfortunately reno s involvement also got relegated to some stifle of laughter as it goes into the implausible domain with laser quick romantic tanglements there was a key element adapted from l eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too while the introductory tale about the story of souls was quite interesting if there s a negative theme here this short wants to play upon it ll be the duplicity of man in between this short and the next was a small scene which reunited our couple from la notte marcello mastroianni and jeanne moreau where the former was painting a landscape which was reminiscent of that in red desert finally we have the final shot this body of dirt with vincent perez as a young man going after a girl irene jacob whom he just met and falling in love with her only to realize that it is a love that is too late it s a relatively talkie piece just like the first story with the characters engaging in conversation while walking the streets of the city they re in which sort of brings to mind richard linklater s before sunrise while on the whole the movie may have succeeded as individual pieces they never quite measure up as a combined effort given the excuse to link them up was a film director s exploration of possible stories and a look for inspiration for his next film

even though the story is light the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie the film consists of four interconnected stories all about different aspect of attraction between man and or woman and how it frequently is ethereal their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto it will flow out like a handful of sand i thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was the more the man desires her it parallels her deep love for god who is infinitely out of reach but never closer to her heart a very good movie 
i saw this film for the first time last night i have been thinking about it all night and this morning i cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet i need to see it again the cinematography is stunning each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has wim wenders s name attached to it it is always tempting to see de chirico in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits in many ways the figure of malkovich walking through the fog and wind of ferarra echoes the shadow of the off canvas statue that haunts milan in the major works of the italo greek painter he is slightly menacing a presence who watches and in his capacity as a film director exerts influence on the entire story the dedicated wenders fan cannot help but think a little bit of damiel and cassiel wandering through the streets of berlin watching all but not directly interacting with the inhabitants and following the himmel uber berlin metaphor the angel or in this case malkovich the director gets to interact with one of the stories at this point i have to bow out of taking this line of criticism too far i need to see the movie again i am fairly sure that this is the thread that will bring malkovich s monologue together perhaps his musings and pontifications are pretentious empty dialog that sound good but cannot possibly be parsed into real communication maybe that is the whole point of it no one can make that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until having done his homework we must be careful when throwing around the word pretentious it is easy to write off anything that smacks of the intellect as pretension but that leads to a terrifying mental state one in which the only conversation seen as genuine earthy or authentic is the most banal when we shun all discussions of philosophy god existence meaning and all that brain candy we are setting our culture up to die a slow stupid and ugly death perhaps this is the warning that wenders and antonioni are giving us it certainly is not the only theme of the film but i think that it cannot be ignored the other and most obvious leitmotif is that of satisfaction there is a lot here on that and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif would well exceed the word limit for this review my advice is to see the film but i offer a caveat it is not an autonomous film at least i don t think so yet some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the zeitgeist before approaching the film par dela les nuages is one of those films 
i was stunned by this film i have been renting antonioni s films rediscovering them and this film showed me the climax and fruits of his years of directing what an eye for setting color and detail i have never seen such visual beauty and poetry filmed before i had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears yes beauty moves me like it moved keats to write ode on a grecian urn this movie is made for the mature emotionally and intellectually audience those hoping to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed i will have to see this film several times before i can truly appreciate it and judge it this film should be required viewing for all cinematographers and directors possibly a truly great film on the order of kurosawa s dreams 
beyond the clouds is in many ways the weirdest film i have ever seen not for its cult appeal gore or even for its ideas but because of the elements that combine to make this a masterpiece of cinema beyond the clouds was directed by michelangelo antonioni one of italy s most famous directors however if you gave this film only a quick watch over passively i mean it would seem one of those melodramatic and often pointless romances this movie deserves great attention to the point of embracing all its cheese by cheese i don t mean a slice but a whole brick of cheddar the music seems like it s from some italian porno the story and dialogue like they are from a corny japanese soap and the metaphors are so obvious you want to smack yourself on the head but once you get passed all this you are engaged in an existential work of art the cheese feeds into the subtle filming and draws our attention perfectly to what needs to be known the basic plot is of four chapters unrelated and all about love what we learn is that no matter what happens or what is said people cannot communicate to each other instead they can only communicate through each other i suppose that s why the dialogue and plot is so cheesy because the conversations are overly irrational with lack of causality and people s reaction overly melodramatic i left that film thinking to myself maybe all life is one big melodrama we judge our feelings towards others as real and purposeful i hate because i have reason but what does the hated think maybe they think that my hate is stupid and arbitrary in other words melodramatic so melodrama is actually an existential function a corny romance is simply human interaction put under a magnifying glass allowing us to see the futility of who we are and what we do this is a great film i recommend it to all 
i m not really sure what to make of this movie especially after seeing a great film like la notte unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the frankfurt film museum so i didn t get to hear malkovich s great voice he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy however as good an actor as he is malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films like the passenger when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity however nonsensical the storyline is the film features two things that make it watchable eye and ear candy the actors and actresses are all beautiful people and the cinematography is marvelous scenes in old italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city reminiscent of la notte the ear candy however is what really makes the film worth watching u and brian eno collaborated on your blue room and beach sequence both of which set the mood perfectly in the film the songs are available on passengers original soundtracks 
i was stunned by this film afterwards i didn t even want to see any films for a long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders typical meandering hero s stream of consciousness so it doesn t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things 
this is a special film if you know the context antonioni in his eighties had been crippled by a stroke mute and half paralyzed his friends who incidentally are the best the film world has arranged for him to direct a last significant film the idea is that he can conjure a story into being by just looking at it so we have a film about a director who conjures stories by simple observation and the matter of the four stories is about how the visual imagination defines love the film emerges by giving us the tools to bring it into being through our own imagination the result is pure movie world every person except the director is lovely in aspect or movement some of these women are ultralovely and they exist in a dreamy misty world of sensual encounter there is no nuance no hint that anything exists but what we see no desire is at work other than what we create i know of no other film that so successfully manipulates our own visual yearning to have us create the world we see he understands something about not touching no one understands van morrison visually like he does morrison s celtic space music is predicated on precisely the same notion the sensual touch that implies but doesn t physically touch antonioni s redhead wife appears appropriately as the shopkeeper and she also directs a lackluster making of film that is on the dvd ted s evaluation of worth watching 
i first saw the movie a couple of years ago and was totally and utterly impressed but its sensuality it is one of the most touching films i have ever seen though it might appear a little bit pretentious and artificial too much beautiful if you will anyway one thing is for sure the camera man has done a great job each picture deserves to be cut off the film and displayed as a separate peace of art comparable to the chirico s or bernard buffet s paintings the music forms a perfect background for the story especially u s one played between the first and the second novels at the beach scene as for the casting i cannot be objective since i like sophie marceau and jean renaue very much and cannot add more to the praising comments of others however the very fact that many people critics and those sophisticated in cinema criticized the movie made me watch it with a more critical eye for the second time no doubt the setting is splendid and the casting is gorgeous but this is somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and cohesive film the second novel when sophie marceau tells her story to malcovic is somehow superficial and does not tell much about the motivations of the people involved was it only about shooting a beautiful and sensual love scene with the naked marceau or what apparently it does not add anything to the idea of the movie and even the husky voice of malcovic is being unable to link it to the main plot other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot which indulges many of the logic fallacies within them the scene when jean reneau is overlooking the city through the huge window of his apartment on the top of the high building is absolutely incredible the feeling of moist air and fine haze which is being spread by the first ferrera scene can literally be sensed through the screen no doubt antonioni is a great master of shades and semi shades my favorite novel is the last one the most romantic deep and meaningful i guess that it the most antonioni like one in the whole movie almost a parable probably the overall positive impression from the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small ghotic italian town with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements fountains with the l eau potable and monumental cathedrals it was laconic but really touching i hope that my impressions and comments on the movie however chaotic they are would motivate somebody to spend an evening watching it it works better with the home theater having somebody caring by your side than in the movie theater enjoy i beg your pardon for the imperfect english and any possible misspellings
here s another antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in metropolitan movie capital l a for a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory where older favorites like antonioni and resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities at first i was disappointed thought the pace to be unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance for years antonioni had found it difficult to find financing at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first reacted to blow up and the passenger i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in l aventurra forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone and quite comedic actually that i couldn t get enough the scene with malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach with the weather so beautifully silver skied and the eno u track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great what a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which antonioni s eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate the odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous sophie marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you this film is unmistakably antonioni s to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm for example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something i did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings before they pulled it and would ve gone back for more if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of antonioni s s films but the s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed dvd version if and when it s released i urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see beyond the clouds and add a piece of magic to the tragic 
beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesn t really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them don t bother if you want simple entertainment this not for you i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i won t if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film 
 a true geek girl s dream high tech high drama smart guys steamy sex and large explosions very large explosions sam waterston is so natural in the role of oppenheimer that tapes of the real oppenheimer sound odd apparently he had a voice similar to ronald reagan the triumph and tragedy of oppenheimer is one of the th century s most stirring dramas and this movie stands as a model of what docu drama ought to be the facts are allowed to speak for themselves while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record not to call attention to themselves an interesting fact some of the technical details used had only recently been declassified and so are of special interest a must see 
 means take up and read which is precisely what i felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film von ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of tobias wolff s new yorker article of the same name the incredible performance by tom noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing sound design cinematography and directing are truly inspired the nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle clever and make the film cinematically more dynamic it s lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again watch out for this young director he s going places 
like a lot of horror fans out there that went looking for the next great scare flick we plundered the asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on leaving no dark haired ghost lady unturned we had good reason to do so the asian market had spawned such terrifying wonders as ringu dark waters juon the grudge and a tale of two sisters by the time takashi miike started ripping the mick out of the genre with one missed call in the market seemed to be drying up leaving it open for mockery and derision despite the continued hollywood remake machine working full steam ahead now don t get me wrong there were still plenty of good asian horrors being made the likes of marebito and shutter to mention but two will stand as minor genre classics some day but the lank haired ghost lady had definitely had her feed at the party and was time to take that success drunk tramp home to bed then along comes a film like noroi the curse a film that is smart enough to pay subtle homage to it s roots yet throws the rulebook out the window whilst doing it what i m about to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here at all the film is a documentary about one of japan s top paranormal investigators as he receives stories and tip offs on ghostly goings on he starts investigating the claims by a woman that she regularly hears a baby crying in the house next door yet there is no baby there apart from a middle aged woman and her son these two disappear sharpish when the reporter pokes his nose around but strange other coincidences start popping up a psychic young girl a mentally ill clairvoyant a pretty young actress who had a strange vision a lot of dead pigeons and a very sinister demon by the name of kagutaba leading to a truly terrifying showdown in a small historical town to say any more on the plot might ruin the fun a bit the film is shot in faux documentary fashion and incorporates footage from tv shows and news reports and the labels via subtitles lets you know where you are in terms of the time line the film has drawn more than a few comparisons to the blair witch project but apart from the shooting format and the creepy trip through the woods late at night the comparison ends there really what is refreshing about noroi is how it doesn t pander to modern horror audiences if you are expecting croaky ghost ladies to pop out of the attic look elsewhere the film s strength lies in it s slow gradual build up of terror a terror so profound that it will stick with you for days after watching it the climax is pretty damned freaky but just when you think the film is over you get treated to the real ending when the credits start to roll and sweet holy f ck is it a killer in terms of acting it is mostly convincing you get some comedy relief from the crazy tin foil covered clairvoyant but that soon dries up half way through the film the film also has a slightly nastier feel than a lot of asian ghost horror as there is a violent streak to some of the events too overall noroi is one to watch on your own late at night not since my first viewing of ringu ten years ago have i been so delightfully creeped out watching a horror film it is one that will itch away at you until it is too late then it is under your skin just let yourself go to this one completely and not a lank haired ghost lady in sight no wonder it has barely been released outside of japan let alone had an american remake lined up yet check this one out if you can essential viewing in my books 
another hand held horror means another divisive movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you re close to the overall content of this movie it s another videotaped horror but this time most of it is edited together in readiness for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends but the creepy moments the genuinely creepy moments were sadly a bit fewer and farther between than i had hoped i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent revelations appeared throughout so i certainly can t recommend this as highly as [ rec] having said that it would be remiss of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about ectoplasmic worms contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand held genre releases of late and the finale is a hair raising doozy see this if you like the last broadcast pulse angel heart 
a documentary filmmaker explores seemingly unrelated paranormal incidents connected by the legend of an ancient demon called the kagutaba from the looks of it the film looks like one of those camcorder movies that have been popular these last few months even one that s going to be released next week paranormal activity however unlike movies like cloverfield rec and blair witch where most of those movies are in complete chaos and mayhem with all of the shakiness this one is basically shown in a traditional documentary style it has tv excerpts and interviews and the scares are very subtle well excluding the last minutes where we go into the chaos effect and where the fear factor is raised up tremendously and it works the film is very engrossing and it makes you think yes you heard me right it makes you think you have to pay attention to those unrelated details given throughout the film and the payoff is great when in course of the film these things start to intertwine one another the film is also very slow moving which in this case is a good thing we as the audience get to absorb the details shown on screen however subtle or blatant they are above all it s a frightening little film i m a person who is scared of ghosts and the paranormal more than killers who slashes away teenage victims so yes the film gave me some nightmares there are some images in here that are really disturbing to watch including one closer in the end where it makes you go what am i looking at well it s better left unanswered there are around ten reoccurring characters in here all of which gave authentic performances in their roles the only thing i don t like about the film is the ending because most questions are left unanswered the question that s it went though my mind it left a bad taste in my mouth however the rest of the film is just engrossing and really frightening don t see this alone in the dark because you ll regret that choice also i can see in a couple of years that hollywood would remake this film that will be interesting 
i for one absolutely loved this movie it is not a typical asian horror where you would see a gruesome looking ghost usually a woman that is going around scaring people you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius this is not the movie for you if you re into gore e g saw hostel or surprise scares where stuff pops out at you hollywood horror slasher films but this movie has an underlying creepy factor throughout the entire movie which i loved noroi is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today s society please don t let the documentary style of filming turn you off why should it it is far superior to the blair witch project because for one the acting in noroi is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you re watching something you re not supposed to be seeing noroi is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen only a few films have made it into my top horror and this movie holds a solid spot on my list 
being a great fan of horror especially asian horror i have seen tons of movies but this one is outstanding why it does have a plot which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies the actors did a good job it feels like a real documentary film even if it s not it does not get boring for a moment the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult perhaps this cult never existed but still it s believable it reminded me of the similarly great movie forbidden siren to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character hori the psychic but this is subjective i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror out of 
i can t praise this film enough it had a lot of that hand held first person shaking camera which i love and some hate because it makes them sick like rec cloverfield and blair witch project it is a long movie for its kind but i didn t even notice because the film was so interesting by just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter s work the movie keeps up the pace making it a real time experience for the viewer while i would never call this film the scariest horror ever made i d have to say it s certainly one of the best i ve seen the fear factor here is constructed by details in the images camera glitches events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations the ending is perfect and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards a second viewing is highly recommended though watch this one alone in the dark don t expect anything and you ll have fun 
noroi follows a documentary filmmaker masafumi kobayashi as he slowly uncovers something mysterious and evil that s leaving a trail of dead bodies in its wake after interviewing a woman who claims to hear loud baby s cries coming from the house next door where there is no baby kobayashi heads over to talk to the neighbor he s greeted with hostility by the unhinged disheveled woman maria takagi who answers the door and promptly slams it in his face and gets a peek at her year old son through a window strangely both the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on their back porch and the woman who first complained about the noises as well as her daughter are both killed in a mysterious accident not long after that this piques kobayashi s interest and he sets out on a quest to find out what s going on he soon uncovers that those with psychic abilities and extra sensory perception seem to be tuning into something sinister unexplainable and possibly even apocalyptic well known year old clairvoyant and tv celebrity kana rio kanno seems to think we may all be doomed but she mysteriously disappears before she can be of much help another female psychic actress marika matsumoto becomes involved as does mr nori a mentally unstable kook psychic who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are being eaten by what he refers to ectoplasmic worms clues eventually lead back to the site of a small village that s now covered by a lake and the legend of an ancient demon known as kagutaba unlike many other hand held horror flicks this one depends just as much on the plot as it does reactionary first person scares thankfully there s something of a storyline here a very interesting and intricate one at that so it doesn t rely on glimpses of horrific things through spastic camera work every once in awhile to keep your interest the way masafumi travels around following leads in search of the truth with well placed jolts along the way reminded me somewhat of the omen in its pacing the film also doesn t entirely consist of footage shot by the documentarian but weaves in news reports and television variety shows as if what we re watching is an already completed documentary that helps to break up some of the monotony usually associated with films shot in this particular style the performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the actual footage either overall it s a well made horror film with lots of plot shifts some suspense and quite a few genuinely creepy moments that s well worth checking out my only real gripe is that it could have used a little trimming here and there and seems to go on a bit too long otherwise pretty good stuff 
this review contains some small yet significant spoilers i just finished watching my copy of noroi and it was great this might sound cheesy but several times during the film i forgot it wasn t real xd the acting is convincing although the acting from masafumi kobayashi playing himself i think seems a bit hokey at times marika matsumoto yuka in takashi shimizu s rinne seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie sometimes she s really good then the next moment she s really cheesy especially at the end s exorcism and subsequent re possession a character that was ridiculous at first was mr hori a man covered in tinfoil believing ectoplasmic worms are coming to eat everyone he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning acting like the stereotypical alien abduction type victim but near the end has some really creepy scenes the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together there are some things that aren t really explained like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutaba boy came from but everything else turned out fine the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving if not the scariest sequences i ve ever had the pleasure to witness all in all noroi is a very fun way to spend hours and the new hong kong r dvd provides great picture and sound most importantly the english subtitles engrish free for a great j horror experience i highly recommend picking it up 
never posted anything here before but after watching noroi i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it firstly do not compare this to blair witch this movie deserves far better than that simply put noroi is probably one of the best horror movies i have ever seen and i have seen a lot i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick but as a documentary filmed by a reporter i think named kobayashi and his cameraman without spoiling to much about the plot i can say it that it starts with kobayashi doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister while the story might not be that original in itself what really hooked me with noroi was the incredibly eerie atmosphere if you re looking for cheap scares and seat jumping scenes this movie might not be for you this movie is all about the mood it presents with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb although not perfect for the general part of the movie far better than in most other movies in this type of genre well enough ranting from me i highly recommend noroi to everyone it is suspenseful creepy well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages 
anyone familiar with horror films knows that most of them are not scary at all some people enjoy gorefests with subpar story lines and character development i personally enjoy horror films that focus on atmosphere and interesting concepts e g a tale of two sisters kairo etc whatever the type of horror film one personally likes there are only a select few that really scare you noroi is one of them this is a documentary style movie which means that the entire film is a compilation of video clips that are linked by the legend of a demonic entity named kagutaba the premise is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with kagutaba then compiled footage from other sources that link with his research what results is a relentlessly chilling experience that feels very real and very disturbing despite the fact that the story itself is fake some have compared noroi with the blair witch project but the only similarity is the documentary style one obvious difference between the films is that noroi scares the viewer by linking events to one another using different sources for example the journalist records the exterior of a house that he is researching and sees something strange on the porch later in the film a clip from another character s home video introduces that very same strange occurrence the viewer s memory links the two incidents and chills start running down their spine another example involves a television show with a child psychic who answers every single question correctly except for one in fact her answer is so wrong that the viewer may wonder what the filmmakers were thinking later on however that wrong answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event this is intelligent film making indeed another difference between noroi and blair witch is that noroi provides not one but two very long finales the second of which is placed a minute after the credits start to roll and is the single greatest scare scene in the history of horror cinema i do not say such things lightly it totally wrecked me in a wonderous way other aspects of film making are well done the legend and ritualistic background of kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job the only over the top performance comes from a guy who s supposed to be crazy anyway so that s expected the cinematography is intentionally gritty because all of the footage is supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders japanese films are not known for their special effects but the effects used here were awesome in some cases they create an other worldly feel e g the static interference or the first finale but in other cases they are alarmingly realistic e g the second finale when all is said and done noroi goes down as the scariest film i ve ever seen i would go so far as to say that there is no film in existence that provides such sheer terror from beginning to end like noroi does see it now 
has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet i can see that a lot of people have inquired but i can t tell if any of them have been successful it s hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country how can this be true and what can we do to change it as an aside i agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site this is an excellent story about events that everyone should be aware of and know something about today lots of us saw this series when we were in college or around that time anyway now we want to share it with our children but we can t if that is true what would some good written materials be that would relay the same information 
www petitiononline com petition html an excellent tv series that should be captured on dvd this was a show i rarely missed i found a petition to bring it back on dvd i recall one show where this obese lady wore a pair of glasses that let her food talk to her needless to say she could not eat her friends so she starved to death another episode had an accountant visiting an underground sewer subway security branch the accountant wanted to shut down the funding for the project as it turns out the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark www petitiononline com petition html
one reasons why they call the s the awesome s is quality television shows like the wonder years war of the worlds the series v amazing stories and many more have always left an impression to each fortunate one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself to top that here comes monsters a series quite unique of its own and a theme fully dedicate to monsters may it be the good the bad and the morbid if you re a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you provided you can find this rare gem even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its grittiness it s indiscriminating use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity i guarantee because i m be sure not to miss this although it s a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world it will always be with those who can always remember 
i think that it s great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it s own horror series this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the th the series nor as adult oriented as the freddy s nightmares it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line up i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up 
this was one of the best half hour horror suspense fantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it stank as far as production values i e the sets went but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i a hardened horror movie shock film and s grind house buff got a little sickened and creeped out great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here my favorite episode was called bug house yeah that was the title i think anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day almost years after it first premiered other shows like tales from the darkside the outer limits and of course the twilight zone were definitely better production values wise but in my opinion they ain t got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was tales from the crypt 
this show has to be my favorite out of all the s horror tv shows like tales from the darkside also from the same creators this show is a rare gem if you agree with me please sign this petition i started to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd here is the petition address www petitiononline com petition html some of my favorite episodes would have to be glim glim and rain dance i also loved the opening intro with the monster family that used to creep me out one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be i don t know if any of you remember that part but that s one of the main things that brings back memories to me i mean come on war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd so i say monsters and also tales from the darkside and friday the th the series should be released too we the fans need to speak our minds we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word 
this picture is an interesting saga of the struggle of pioneers led by daniel boone in the wilderness of cumberland gap while being threatened by hostile indians a treacherous frenchman is the cause of all the trouble between the settlers and the red men while boone tries to convince the indians that the pioneers only want to build homes and live in peace the film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production but there are good action scenes although somewhat violent for its time the cast is comprised of b actors but they are all good especially lon chaney as the indian chief bruce bennett is okay as boone but is a bit too clean cut and soft spoken to be believable as a frontiersman the dialogue is rather trite but the scenery lends itself to the realism of the kentucky backwoods 
i was enchanted by niami s debut i hope that we ll soon see more of his work i was lucky enough to catch the film during its brief nyc run and it struck me as a worthy successor to such downtown s flicks as desperately seeking susan and after hours but with a gentle european whimsey that made it fresh and fun a strong ensemble cast playing mostly against type was a pleasure and i thought the complexly inter threaded plots were just right sandra bernhard puts in her best performance since king of comedy while peter stormare is hilarious and ling bai touching see it 
despite its new york setting new york characters summer in the city is not an american movie it is better than that what is most unusual is the mixing of styles and genres director niami s shows a deft touch in combining comedy with tragedy pathos with drama the secret of niami s success appears to be a smorgasboard of great characters each could have their own film built around them and then filling them out with beautifully realized performances from one of the most wonderfully eclectic casts one would struggle to find in the same country let alone in the same movie ranging from bai ling to ornella muti robert burke to peter stormare who here reveals that he has a lot more in him than the bad guy stereotypes he plays in hollywood pictures even sandra bernhard is funny here an added bonus cream on the substantial cake is john cale s soundtrack 
this film did a wonderful job of capturing nyc stereotypes at there best if you want a simple cute story however you won t find it here the related tales are woven together in a manner that does an excellent job of capturing the close knit yet contrastingly anonymous lifestyle that is manhattan a perfect watch for those who enjoy and can laugh at new york life in its most natural state 
i put this film in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to nyc and i couldn t believe i d never heard of it anywhere it has all the makings of a cult classic starting with the characters they are archetypal roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them peter stormare and bai ling s performances were particularly strong their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time brimming with a subtle quirky humor that is sadly all too rare in american films these days writer director ramin niami does a beautiful job of weaving these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past highly recommended 
this is the best work i have ever seen on television the story is compelling all the more so because it is true the writers did their homework the accuracy of events is well documented the acting is great this has to be the best role sam waterston has ever had and the black and white cinematography was exceptional my only regret is that it is not available to buy a few years ago i contacted someone involved with the production either with pbs or in england and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs at the time this was a bbc production and ran in the u s on american playhouse there is such an interest in seeing this just hard to believe no one can make it available 
the director ramin niami delivers the goods with somewhere in the city this hilarious farce i believe is in the tradition of a mel brooks comedy niami pokes fun at new york society by creating the believable eccentric and tragic characters of one tenement apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them peter stormare s performance as a gay shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the hopelessness and laugh ability of self centered ambition sandra bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight self obsessed therapist i really enjoyed sandra s performance immensely especially since i haven t really been a very big fan until now bai ling ornella muti and bulle ogier round out an international ensemble par excellence i loved the scene with robert john burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn t plan a robbery if their lives depended on it with a cameo appearance by mayor ed koch and a solid performance by paul anthony stewart the revolutionary momma s boy somewhere in the city entertains without missing a beat 
i agree with the aussie s comments for the most part however there id seem to be a fairly decent plot if unoriginal christina kelli mccarty inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge she gets reacquainted with chip bobby johnston whom she had known when she was growing up in there the plot thickens when james paul logan arrives with his new stripper friend shene devinn lane because christina had been james stripper friend in years gone by and the implication is that james had done her wrong somehow to add interest to the movie sophia linn monique parent a romance novelist shows up as a guest at the lodge as do eric sebastien guy and linda flower pair of lawyers from the city james sicks the local building codes inspector on christina s business as one of his dirty tricks to shut her down so the question is how far will james go to sabotage the lodge and will he succeed watch for devinn lane here and in beauty betrayed she seems to be making a transition from the hard core business to the r world another notable is samantha mcconnell playing the role of bait clearly the most outrageous character name in the movies 
wow i ve sure seen quite a bit of kelli mccarty this summer i didn t know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years it s like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me much like michelle hall did a couple of years ago passion s peak is the third quality softcore flick i ve seen kelli mccarty in with girl for girl and house of love being the others desire and deception was okay but it wasn t spectacular there s spoilers in this review so read only if you want to the story begins with christina kelli mccarty heading out of the big city and to the mountains she has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge before she can even set her things down some woman named kim uncredited in this film but quite the aggressive one begins booking guests to stay there now she has to get the house into shape quickly in comes chip bobby johnston a childhood friend to the rescue chip helps her get the house in workable condition she hires two local slackers to work in her lodge chip s sister bait samantha mcconnell and her sex buddy hank now the guests start coming the first to arrive are eric and linda flower two stereotypical money first lawyers linda and eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup sad stuff there next there s romance novelist sophia played by b movie goddess monique parent she s using that silly alias scarlet johansing again and she s got a very professional look this time with blonde hair of course it wouldn t be monique if she didn t have at least one scene where she plays with herself and she obliges during one of eric and linda s sex scenes james and shene devinn lane yes the porn star devinn lane show up for a little weekend getaway as well unbeknownst to shene james and christina have quite a history james and christina used to date but christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge james comes up to the lodge to get christina back but his plan backfires christina spills the beans to shene which causes shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now single eric and they leave together bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with hank and christine finds true love with chip with sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel in fact if you ask me this whole movie played out like a romance novel i don t know if the screenwriter was going for that effect but i sure got that impression sophia had some of the best lines in this film playing up the idea that this is a live action romance novel she seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on now to the sex there was a fair amount of it and it was the usual bump and grind stuff monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes this film was tapeworthy and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes women a monique was simply monique out of all the softcore actresses i ve seen over the years she s the best at acting in my opinion she can really act and be sexy which is why she s holding on to the position in my skinemax top kelli mccarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera passions i don t know why she s not doing more of these flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role samantha mcconnell continues to impress me and devinn lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it sex b it was good but not awe inspiring spectacular plenty of moaning don t watch the r rated version trust me most of the good stuff is taken out my grade is for the uncut version story b a solid storyline which throws in a contrived ooh the building inspector s gonna shut us down subplot toward the end which messes up things the underlying story between christina and james was nice and sophia s dialogue full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels was a nice touch overall b i found this movie to be quite entertaining it s not a surefire softcore hall of famer like girl for girl is but it s a respectable addition to the skinemax collection 
one of keli mccarthy s best this movie is filled with sex and nudity it has gorgeous sexy women and some sexy settings believe me there are many spicy and steamy sex scenes but not as hot as the women we have outside settings a hot tub beds of course and some other nice places to have sex monique parent is great in the opening sex sequence where she behaves like a naughty girl keli is amazing she s extremely sexy and performs in at least hot sex scenes my favorite is when she has sex during a picnic or something like that she has this short dress removed and the rest you can go figure it out renee rea also has a sexy sex scene where again she demonstrates that beautiful cute faces can also perform great in soft core sex movies the most memorable scene in my opinion comes near the ending it s a double sex feature that has to do with hottub sex intense sex and kelli mccarthy receiving it real hard so loud that the couple in the hottub feel interrupted the scene is long steamy very explicit and fun my favorite from the other good scenes include keli getting it on the woods really kinky then dressed as a bride renne rea always super gorgeous dressed like a skater girl has a steamy sex scene nice please watch this movie if you enjoy b soft core sex it s among the best from the new millennium i had a blast with it 
this was a very nice soft core movie for both men and women plenty of nudity sex but without the overall raunch you ll usually find they could not have done a better job in casting as the entire ensemble was stunning trust me guys if you want to get your woman in the mood get something with bobby johnston in it and i m sure lovely monique parent samantha mcconnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual male unfortunately bobby and monique do not share a scene together and if you are aware of a movie where they do please pm me i d love to know the photography was much better than usual so was the story predictable but nice sweet natured and romantic at the very least it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries full of bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts i give this 
don t know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didn t seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless 
i loved this moviee well i loved the romance part with colby and the girl rachel got her name i honestly was only interested in those too i loved them in the movie i want to see more movies like that but please no more sad endings where they cant be gether it made me cry but the romance between them the plot the trauma everything was great i just was more into colby and rachel ha ha everything about this movie was thrilling the kind to keep you glued to your seat because i sure was honestly my only personal want would be more focused between the couple colby and rachel and at least a decent ending i hated the ending a better one could have been more thought out not the fact of forcing colby to his death and rachel having a son the ending would have killed the movie 
this has to be one of the best movies we have seen and we highly recommend it for it s exposure of the injustices of bigotry billy wirth is an incomparable actor and truly awesome as corby white wolf however felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes this is a movie that can be watched over and over without tiring 
i am a big fan of this film and found the tv mini series children of the dust the version fans should look for at least minutes or more are cut on the dvd version of this film i would also suggest viewers who enjoyed this film to check out the book there is a more rounded storyline with corby whitewolf and rachel more on black history and buffalo solders there were two many storylines for the series or this film sidney poitier only shows he gets better with age the talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of gypsy smith and regina taylor were wonderful viewing i also enjoyed the billy wirth joanna going storyline they seems to play off each other well billy wirth is of course the model of indian vision the look the attitude the dream of every woman who was wanted to be carried off in one of those romance novels by a native hero worked for me also much more could have been done with this storyline but it did give the viewer a brief glimpse of racial problems back in the s white take over of native schooling lack of black pioneers to setup towns in the west michael moriarty maxwell as always a great actor comes across as a very caring and confused teacher not sure if the whites should be interfering with native culture for anyone who enjoys characters and watching them change this film is for you i thought the chemistry between poitier s character and that of the orphan whitewolf very moving and thought wirth and poitier worked very well together billy wirth did some of his best scenes when working with poitier going got on my nerves sometimes when you want to just stop and shake her or give her a wake up and grown up call but on the whole it was a great evening of entertainment look for the two tape version of this mini series if you are a fan you will really see the difference 
i don t understand why more people have not commented on this other than the fact that perhaps not very many have seen it it s an amazing cast of characters one after another after another all done by the guy who wrote the play if you don t like filmed plays you may not like this after all plays usually don t look good on tv but it s a one man show that will have you paying attention throughout highly recommended 
i ve always liked barbara stanwyck who was perhaps the hardest working lead actress of the s and s although few of her movie roles are memorable today she is remembered most for the tv show the big valley stanwyck worked so much because she was durable it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence and so it was for christmas in connecticut a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn t even really about christmas it does however have stanwyck and dennis morgan as well as some supreme character actors including sydney greenstreet and s k sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in than they do today to begin the plot concerns a magazine writer stanwyck who the magazine s readers believe is a domestic goddess married with a child and living on a farm in connecticut but who is really single lives in new york city and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking could anyone get away with such a fraud even then apparently and even the owner of the magazine greenstreet is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and stanwyck greenstreet a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship morgan and stanwyck s restaurateur friend s z sakall find themselves spending christmas in connecticut at a farm belonging to stanwyck s boorish boyfriend reginald gardiner you can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must gardiner wants stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all morgan and stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married regardless they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh meanwhile the incredibly naive greenstreet character who has seen stanwyck and morgan go off together but still doesn t get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping stanwyck and morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind at this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd not funny ha ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did the good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after i watch this movie every year at christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in and because of a long held fascination with barbara stanwyck thank goodness it was set at christmas or like percent of stanwyck s movies it would have been long ago forgotten and we would not get to see it each year anew 
a very well directed version of eric bogosian s stage play well worth checking out for bogosian s great characters and for anyone who wants to see how to bring a play to the movies correctly 
eric bogosian s ability to roll from character to character in this one man show exhibits his true range as a character actor each persona has their own message to convey about truth society class drugs etc this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience 
this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched at the age of i was up late and ran across the movie it was on the usa channel gilbert godfrey s up all night i will never forget at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues some sexual you know is a very rough and weird age it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl and being a young lady this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me i now have a daughter that is have been searching for a couple years for this movie if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age 
many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often a movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients this film follows three friends gary rick and david the big apple misadventures into the world of first time sex and true love along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it s ending if you haven t been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take a look sprinkled with many memorable s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace l a v truly is an original film a rarity among films of it s genre 
the last american virgin was one of the few teenage comedies that i really enjoyed the subject matter and the acting was well above the usual tripe that hollywood was and still is cranking out these days but for awhile the smaller studios were producing movies about teenagers that wasn t toned downed or soften for the kiddies the men pulling the strings behind this production were from your friends from cannon three teenage buddies are trying to lose their virginity whilst still in high school they ll do anyone or anything to achieve their dream goal the sensitive one of the group andrew monsoon what s to find the right girl while his two best friends will take whatever they can get one day the kid finds his perfect girl diane franklin but fate would play one of their foul tricks his best friend moves on in and sweeps her off of her feet after knocking her up the sensitive kid helps the girl get back on her feet and pays for her abortion he still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart meanwhile his best friend has a very violent falling out over getting her dream girl preggers still he tries his best to get her to love him the night comes when he pops the question to her but his heart is shattered when he sees her dancing with his former best friend in tears the kid leaves the party what i enjoyed about this movie was that it pulled no punches instead of being filled with phony situations it was very realistic honest and brutal the movie s filled with it s share of funny moments and hysteria i have to recommend this film for fans of teenage comedies highly recommended 
i see there are great reviews of this film already i ve got a few points to comment on reasons i thought there was something special about this film first and foremost the film is realistic it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager but that s really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time second the good guy the guy who treats women with respect doesn t get the girls that s the way it is in real life just the same he s too nice for his own good people are just selfish third it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self confidence i mean that role already takes confidence from the actor i m not just talking about the character overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky partyin teen sex comedies at the rental shelf don t get me wrong it s not all sad it s a good laugh as well 
i first saw this movie when i was about years old it has been one of my favorites since it s so perfect in all it s glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i won t ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie it s genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesn t like she had a nice little body though i can t believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases almost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too 
i saw this movie for the first time just a short while ago if you ask me it does not get the credit it deserves it is a little like american pie meets fast times at ridgemont high but with more depth it handles the same issues as both movies but in a way that holds with it some grain of truth the ending is sad but that is how life is i think everyone should see it i have it on dvd form and it took such a long time to find it too that should say something heh and another thing i will add is that it is quite difficult finding the soundtrack i believe they stopped it but the soundtrack to this movie is amazing it has songs by artists like the commodores u devo reo speedwagon the cars kc and the sunshine band and many more 
i totally loved this movie tried to buy it and can t find it a must see a movie you can watch again and again funny but also a tear jerker in one really good album for the movie it s a really good s movie i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie cause i would the actors in it acted really good there s a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie that s what makes this movie so good so go out and try to rent this one you won t regret it it s an older movie but it s worth watching i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon but i m sure it would not be the same anyone who hasn t seen it go rent it 
i don t think i will include any spoilers but if i do i can cover my butt the last american virgin came in a time were such teenage coming of age high school sex romps were the rave films such as prepies hot times and the popular porky s were making mucho money yet it is the last american virgin the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations it is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity the go to the wrong places prostitutes the dangerous ones older woman with jealous boyfriend and the convenient ones luring their high school female counterparts the movie has a lot of funny moments and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star it is worth remembering for a fantastic s soundtrack that includes devo the cars journey and others by today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a nc rating but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain while love might be right in front of us it is a little piece of s americana and worth having in your movie collection 
while it s not perfect it s close love barbara stanwyck sz sakall sidney greenstreet dennis morgan robert shayne superman s police chief the housekeeper the waiter at restaurant felix and the judge i can go on and on this movie has been part of my family s holiday tradition since i was a youngster and my children grew up with it too the baby swallowed the watch was always my son s favorite line sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly funny s z sakall dennis morgan has a few great songs too i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake blah 
reality before reality tv copy of fast times at ridgemont high a precursor to say anything that s grittier i can t decide but the soundtrack is the s blondie journey reo speedwagon devo lionel richie and u i can t believe this they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today i remembered this like a teenager mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism why i was a horny teenager in the s watching it again i just can t describe how much i love that rose play by kimberly richardson turns out to be the voice of pepper ann in the s and she was almost when she was in last american virgin playing alongside year olds fantastic complete cheese reality fantasy and comedy with a sincere cherry on top 
i really like this movie i like it not just because it s a great early s movie with a great soundtrack but i found that it has some thought provoking moments they are just moments not the entire film it s definitely not like less than zero the scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems like the betrayal of trust these problems are not easily resolved or forgotten by the characters certain scenes will stand out and invite reflection on one s own teenage experiences and how those experiences may have affected one s character and outlook as an adult you can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults must face and about your own experiences or you can just pay attention to the boys quest to de virginize themselves either way it s a good movie 
when i watched this movie in my adolescence i attempted for the soundtrack some bands of the soundtrack i still didn t know however during the film i already noticed her quality u blondie police quincy jones commodores sensational soundtrack in brazil there is a long time this film didn t pass in tv today he passed in cable tv and i remembered to access the site to do the comment the end of the film surprised me a lot but it is what happens in the real life not always what thought about being the ideal it is what happens the life brings us a lot of surprises 
this movie was release when i was and i could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed that was over years ago and i haven t seen the movie since this time around i cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is life is not always fair and the good guys don t always win in fact i think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls also it doesn t matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you girls boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise sometimes you just gotta let go and say next gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for karen this is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone i remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics the acting is not quite there compared with fast times at ridgemount high but it kicks ass over this movie simply because ftarh has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending nice guys finish last gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive we all know a david fun guy who makes you laugh some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them especially at that age i have experienced that first hand great sound track too u i will follow jesus is it that old 
as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it s underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i ve never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex sarved teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary s friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy but it s so much more than that it s a very honest movie it s also very ish which i love if you love the s or grew up in the s rent this movie but there may be some people that don t like the s but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in i think it s very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it s an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin out of 
it plays like your usual teenage audience t a movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak if it was made today it d be considered an art house movie it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying the whole teen flick formula is adhered to but nothing turns out the way you d expect imagine a director s cut of it s a wonderful life where at the end james stewart wasn t allowed to return to the real world an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre it makes you feel dirty afterwards there is no redemption for the characters i m amazed it ever got made the eighties version of detective story 
 the last american virgin along with fast times at ridgemont high is one the last great teen films ever made it is tender tale of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties much maligned by critics that it was a sophomoric banal attempt to recreate the magic of fast times at ridgemont high these same critics fail to recognize that the two films were actually filmed concurrently during late and released at only slight intervals from one another either way the studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers are confronted with as they reach their sexual maturity especially considering the heart wrenching discovery the protagonist gary is confronted with in the end american pie this is not the story revolves around a trio of male teenagers and their mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits gary is the least successful of the group hence the tagline last american virgin secretly gary lusts after karen who is involved with rick his best friend rick and karen begin having sex and karen gets pregnant only to be dumped by rick who is not interested in the obvious responsibility which lies before him gary glides into help karen which leads to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion overall as a film i find it was very successful as a comedy as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men and a remarkable coming of age tale dealing with issues such as envy unrequited love and abortion which are just as pertinent today as they were over twenty years ago also it has one of the rockingest soundtracks ever made 
spoilers this movie has it s problems but in the end it gets the message across i liked it because it ends the way things really do the nice guy tries and tries gets his heart broken several times but in the end there is no typical hollywood ending it ends the way such things always end or at least always have in my own and friends experiences anyone who thinks that the ending to this isn t how it really happens as the first comment seemed to believing that the girl would come around realize she s dating an asshole who treats her bad because he doesn t care about her at all is either naive or lives in a more perfect world than i i give it extra points simply because it wasn t afraid to end on a down note give no real resolution just the main character left heartbroken confused and alone as so many men of countless generations have been before 
ahhh the s makes me think back to the really crazy time we were facing in america fresh off the do what feels good s the last american virgin comes as a wolf in sheep s clothing as yet another teenage sex comedy from the glory days oh sure there s sex but i can t think of another movie ok this and fast times at ridgemont high that really wasn t killing time between topless teenage scenes there was some pretty good stuff here amongst the cleavage the movie follows three hormonal friends gary wanting to lose his virginity rick stud incarnate and david overweight but not inexperienced as they try desperately hard to make sure gary joins the world of manhood but a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger gary falls for karen pretty brunette who loves the bad boys and can t seem to follow through with any sexual conquest that david and rick can facilitate only trouble is rick and karen get hot and heavy and karen skips a period it s gary who is by her side as she goes to get her abortion and it s gary who truly cares but who is karen dancing with by film end rick subtract the r and add a d where necessary what separates this film from others from the s we think about is that by god they attempt some real drama here and not of the my parents just pulled in the driveway variety and you know what i bought it it wasn t sloppy it wasn t far fetched and when gary sees rick dancing with karen at the house party at the end of the film i actually felt sorry for the guy our teenage romeo actually believed in unrequited love and when his heart was broken at the end it all sort of touched me so all the t a aside there s an actually pretty believable and engaging story here oscar worthy not by a mile but i don t know that i d lump it into the let s get laid category either like fast times at ridgemont high they actually were trying to do a true film here letting the hi jinx in between fall where it may 
what looks like a ho hum porky s rip off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love the story concerns three friends gary ricky and david who spend their after school hours looking for sex when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities it is funny and sad at the same time it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made you know the guy meets girl guy loses girl guy gets girl back in the final frame formula that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl maybe that is why i liked the film so much the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker it also might be one of the most realistic endings i ve ever seen in a love story 
i absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist barbara stanwyck for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful connecticut home the trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a ww hero as guests during the christmas holidays why is she worried because she lives in a small new york apartment isn t married and doesn t have a baby and can t cook at all hilarity and romance ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face keep from being fired by the magazine owner played by sydney greenstreet this is a delightful comedy one that i highly recommend to classic movie lovers
