###phases of trials:
- phase 1:
	- 10 - 30 people
	- usually not controlled
	- figuring out tolerable dose
- phase 2:
	- 30 - 100 people
	- get information on efficacy
- phase 3:
	- 100+ 
	- efficacy + safety
	- controlled, randomized
- phase 1 + 2 = learning; 3 = demonstration

1. Comparison structure: parallel, crossover, group allocation designs
parallel:
- simultaneous A/B groups
- randomization removes bias
- comparson between treatment grops

crossover:
- AB and BA
- first treatment --> washout --> second treatment
- potential permanent effects
- first treatment effects may carry over to second
- goal not to compare AB vs BA, but A vs B, then B vs A

__randomization unit__: the level that randomization happens (community, school, clinic, patient)

group allocation design:
- e.g. 2 villages, A for 1st, B for 2nd

Factorial:
- run 2 tests on the same set at the same time
- when: economical (99% of time), test interaction

Large, Simple Design:
- modest benefits require largee sample size
- less precision is tolerated, countered with large numbers

Testing for Equivalency instead of superiority:
- large sample size
- Flip the null hypothesis to be: there is a difference between treatments

Testing for Non-inferiority 
- determine if A is at least as good as B
- H0 = i....

Adaptive Design:
- trials would change based on whats seen in the trial
- adaption must be pre-defined
- e.g. change sample size based on preliminary data
